		<title>Introduction and Rationale</title>
		<para>
			No one wants to work in a vacuum. CSU, Chico has used the
			same basic technology setup to deliver synchronous online
			instruction since 2000 when the satellite program was
			transitioned to an online format. In the mean time
			technology has progressed at an accelerated rate... where in
			2000 there were a few vendors now there are several. Tools
			have been developed to both support and augment the
			synchronous tools used.
		</para>
		<para>
			The survey grew up of a need to evaluate what other schools
			are doing in terms of synchronous distance learning tools
			and how these tools are being supported by the campuses.
			Whatever the reasons for having skipped a technological
			generation are; now CSU, Chico needs to play catch up. The
			information gathered in this survey will inform later steps
			and stages in our new Distance Learning tools selection
			process, support models and procedures and, eventually, lead
			to a model that will take CSU, Chico to a leadership
			position in Distance Learning.

	<sect1 id="methodology">
		<title>Methodology and Survey Development</title>
		<para>
			When developing the methodology it was decided that a survey
			was the best tool to conduct this project. Because surveys
			are static instruments it was also decided to request
			contact information for potential follow up questions. The
			survey will certainly generate more questions than the data
			can answer. It has been made clear from the beginning to
			participants that, while their personally identifying
			information would be kept confidential, the researcher will
			contact those institutions whose information has generated
			new research questions.
		</para>

		<para>The survey was broken into 4 distinct areas:</para>

		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Informed Consent as required by the University's
					Human Subject Review Committee
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Demographics about the respondent and their
					institution
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Demographics about the respondent institution's
					Synchronous and Asynchronous courses, LMS
					Integration and the way in which the software used
					for Distance Learning was selected
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Specific information about the respondent's
					Synchronous Distance Learning Software and its
					support model for both faculty and students
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>

		<para>
			Once the author had an initial version of the survey it was
			reviewed by several members of Academic Technologies and
			after several meetings the final version of the survey was
			completed and submitted to Human Subjects for review and
			approval. See
			<xref linkend="Lessons" />
			for some of the lessons learned in the development and
			administration of the survey instrument.
		</para>

		<para>
			When the survey instrument was developed then the team had
			to decide how to deliver the instrument. The author briefly
			considered creating a PDF and sending it via email to
			potential respondents allowing them to self-select for
			completion of the survey. This was deemed impractical due to
			the number of responses expected. The Center for Excellence
			in Teaching and Learning (CELT) owns a license for Survey
			Monkey (
			<link xlink:href="http://www.surveymonkey.com" />
			). Since the technology is available and it makes the
			collection of data more manageable it was decided to use
			Survey Monkey to administer the survey and collect the
			results.
		</para>

		<para>
			The survey was originally sent to 5 lists with 2 additional
			groups (Community College Users and Community College
			Distance Learning Coordinators) being added later when the
			survey was forwarded to community college users and Distance
			Learning Coordinators. These additional groups of respondent
			explain the high percentage of respondents from Community
			Colleges.
		</para>

		<para>
			The survey was sent originally to the following lists:

		<para>
			The variety of groups the survey was sent to was deliberate.
			The team wanted to ensure responses that were as varied as
			possible. As mentioned above, when the chance was offered to
			have the survey forwarded to Community College users it was
			deemed a good opportunity to expand the base of respondents
			and to gather information towards future research.

			<title>Lessons Learned</title>
			<para>
				No matter how careful you are in developing a survey
				there are always things that could have been done
				different to improve the survey's overall response rate.
			</para>
			<para>Some of the specific issues include:</para>

			<sect3 id="clarification">
				<title>
					Clarification about the voluntary nature of the
					survey
				</title>
				<para>
					For some of the respondents from the community
					colleges in particular there was a perception that
					they were required to complete the survey whether it
					applied to them or not. Some of the feedback seems
					to indicate that they were required to complete the
					survey regardless of what the informed consent
					statement indicates.
				</para>
				<para>
					This may have had to do with the fact that for this
					particular group the survey originated from the
					Community College's Chancellors office and not
					directly from the authors of the survey and
					therefore carried a more authoritative message to
					those who received it
				</para>
				<para>
					Future surveys should clearly indicate and request
					people who forward the survey indicate that
					participation in the survey is strictly voluntary.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3 id="clarity">
				<title>
					Survey Clarity and Specific Language in Instructions
				</title>
				<para>
					As clear as we thought we had made the survey there
					was still a lot of confusion as to who the target
					audience was and who should answer the survey. Some
					people passed it over to their Distance Learning
					coordinators and others completed the survey as best
					as they could.
				</para>
				<para>
					Even among the Community College's Distance Learning
					Coordinators there was confusion as to what
					information the survey sought to gather. There was
					an email where a Distance Learning Coordinator who
					indicated that the answers just provided were of no
					use as survey material because the coordinator had
					not realized that were were requesting information
					about synchronous Distance Learning and his program
					was fully asynchronous. While not a generalized
					comment it calls into question the clarity of the
					instructions provided with the survey.
				</para>
				<para>
					Our expectation when developing the survey was that
					people who received it but were not able to answer
					it would pass it along to whoever they thought would
					be able to complete it for their institution. This
					was not the case which probably accounts for the
					number of faculty who completed the survey. See
					<xref linkend="user-distribution" />
					for respondents' role within their institutions.
				</para>

			</sect3>

			<sect3 id="wording">
				<title>Question Wording and Stating Quantities</title>
				<para>
					In addition to the question about the clarity of the
					instructions there was some feedback regarding the
					wording of some of the questions, in particular
					those that requested distinction between synchronous
					and asynchronous Distance Learning courses.
				</para>
				<para>
					Where we ask number of courses that are synchronous
					and asynchronous Distance Learning courses it may
					have been better to use percentages rather than
					number of courses to eliminate part of the confusion
					created by the wording of the questions.
				</para>
				<para>
					We also assumed a level of understanding from our
					audience in terms of what the objectives of the
					survey were. There was a lot of confusion and it was
					clear in comments and direct feedback that this was
					not always the case

			<blockquote>
				<para>Custom Flash Media Server applications</para>
			</blockquote>

			<para>
				Either as a standalone application or as part of
				Accrobat connect Professional, flash is a very flexible
				delivery platform. In addition to the modules or "pods"
				there is the flexibility of building local "pods" to
				acomodate local needs and locally required elements.
			</para>

			<blockquote>
				<para>
					WebCT, some Windows Media streaming, correspondence,
					and telecourses (correspondence plus videotape). We
					DO NOT design courses for synhronous delivery. It
					prohibits participation by many students, and
					doesn't work well across time zones. We have
					students all over the world and that makes
					synchrnous media a no-go.
				</para>
			</blockquote>

			<para>
				World-wide access is becoming more and more of an issue.
				With online access not being geographically restricted
				neither are the options to take online courses. Schools
				like Chico have a set schedule where the students have
				the option of engaging with the content either live or
				via archived recordings of class sessions.
			</para>
			<para>
				Other schools have decided not to implement synchronous
				programs for a variety of reasons or have limited the
				use of synchronous tools to individual faculty members.
			</para>
			<blockquote>
				<para>
					We offer live videoconferences, not avail. on line
				</para>
				<para>Poly COM, Apple iChat, DVTS, Skype</para>
				<para>
					Even though you have only listed web conference
					tools as synchronous DL, we still use interactive,
					two-way video

				<para>
					Mediasite by Sonic Foundry Video Conferencing
					(Tandberg h.323)
				</para>
				<para>
					Note: currently we do not use synchronous distance
					learning over the Internet. We do offer a suite of
					telecourses, a few featuring live lectures, most
					recorded. Increasingly these lectures are being
					integrated into our asynchronous online courses as

				A suprisingly large number of respondents, mostly from
				Community Colleges continue to use their video
				infrastructure for delivering instructional content.
				They also make extensive use of cable television
				channels and satellite television (Direct TV or Dish
				Network) for delivering instruction
			</para>

				CCCConfer (
				<link

				) provides Synchronous conferencing services for the 108
				campuses of the California Community College system. The
				service initially used Wimba products but now has
				changed to Elluminate Live.

			<para>
				There also seems to be a trend in asynchronous courses
				to use the synchronous tools built into the LMS (Moodle,
				Angel, Desire2Learn, Blackboard, eCollege, WebCT and
				Etudes NG were mentioned as delivery vehicles.) A
				concern with this model is the strength of the LMS
				network connection, the hardware it is running on and
				the number of simultaneous connections
			</para>
			<para>
				Etudes NG should be singled out and analyzed in more
				detail. Originally a project developed by an Instructor
				at Foothill College as an alternative to the big
				commercial Learning Management Systems; Etudes morphed
				into a Sakai derivative driven by a Consortium (

				) with a current membership of 23 community colleges.

				A surprising number of instructors find themselves also
				having to fill the role of technical support for their
				students. This may be tied to "lone ranger" faculty who
				decided to implement synchronous solutions on their own.

			<para>
				Many responses include online resources as a means to
				support students taking online courses. It would be
				interesting to see what led to this kind of support and
				what the difference would be with a traditional physical

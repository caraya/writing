      <title>Author's soapbox</title>
    </info>

    <para>What do you say when you love writting and have an affinity for
    science fiction? You put it some place where other people may or may not
    be able to access it and, hell, they may even like them.</para>

    <para>Every one of the stories in these pages has a personal meaning. Some
    may only be clear to myself and the people I consider my friends. Others
    have a more clear meaning.</para>

    <para>Each chapter is a separate story, they are written in this form
    because of a limitation of docbook (or my knowledge of docbook). The
    stories may have common characters and settings, but they are mean to
    stand on their own and have been written at different periods in my life.
    Some of these stories were originally written in Spanish and then
    translated to English because I loved the stories too much.</para>

    <para>Some of the people who know me the best will notice some of these
    stories are over 15 years old and that I've decided to resurrect them in
    order to have a more coherent underlying theme arch for them. Other
    stories are spur of the moment and have nothing to do with my "Tales from
    the Federation Archives" series. Yet other stories are inspired in RPGs
    that I used to play and that I still love to play.</para>

    <para>Some things to keep in mind: Some of these stories are at least 12
    years old and show it. Be patient as I update them and, hopefully, make
    them better ;-)</para>

    <para>these stories are also available as <link xlink:href="stories.html">

    <title>Robotech and Sentinels stories</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>Being the first RPG system that I ever played (yeah, I skipped D
      &amp; D until much later) I wasn't surprised that it was also the first
      universe that wasn't mine where I started writing. Robotech on all 3
      generations and the, sadly, never finished Sentinels, gives a lot of
      freedom and flexibility when writing stories.</para>

      <para><citetitle>Free for All</citetitle> is my writing of an RPG
      scenario that, unfortunately, we never got to play and it asks the
      question "How much sacrifice is enough?" The character of Alan
      Fredericks is a composite of several people I know, as is Wei Mei Chu
      (although the name may be a better give away with her).</para>

      <para><citetitle>A long December</citetitle> is based on the Christmas
      JAG episode dedicated to Bob Hope and the USO. Characters are creation
      of the Author. Any similarity with any person living or dead is pure
      coincidence (even if intentionally so :)). This story is dedicated to
      all the men and women who are away from their families during the
      holidays, and at any time, while serving their country's armed forces.
      May they all come home safe to their loved ones.</para>

      <para>These stories are individual and do not necessarily have any
      connection with each other. They are also not related to the
      <citetitle>Stories from the Front</citetitle> stories.</para>

<emphasis role="bold">The Mall</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">New Washington DC</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">Christmas, 2090</emphasis>
</literallayout>

      <para />

      <para>The memorial wall was full of the names of the men and women who
      had given their lives on the defense of the United States of America and
      later Earth from as far back as 1960... well before the Zentraedi had
      come and made a mess out of everything.</para>

      <para>It was not unusual for it to be snowing in New Washington DC.
      After the Invid had left the planet, many members of the races of the
      local group had come to help Earth heal itself from all the imposible
      demands that humans had put on her over the years and centuries. One of
      the first things the new North American Government did was to rebuild
      their capital on DC.... There had been talk about moving the capital to
      somewhere more defensible, but the old guard had prevailed. I like it
      better where it is</para>

      <para>I found my father's name on the wall without major difficulties,
      although there seemed to be more names on the wall than there were last
      year. People were standing or kneeling in front of the section of the
      wall that had the name of their loved ones. There was someone else
      touching my father's name, someone whom I didn't know.</para>

      <para>She looked at the name for a long time before noticing that I was
      there. She turned towards me and asked, "You must be Lt. Wayne
      Anderson's son, right?"</para>

      <para>I was dumbfounded. How the hell did this woman know who I was?
      "Yes, ma'am, I'm Lt. Commander Benjamin Anderson. Wayne Anderson was my
      father." I wanted to know more about this woman who already knew so much
      about me.</para>

      <para>"I knew it!" The woman's smile grew brighter with my admision.
      "You're the living image of your father when he was your age." The woman
      continued the mystery.</para>

      <para>"Excuse me, ma'am. May I ask how do you know of my father?" My
      friends say that I can be an ass when I really want to and you can bet
      your wings that this time I wanted to know how this woman knew
      pops.</para>

      <para>She smiled again, "I apologize, I guess I should have introduced
      myself before asking such personal questions." She extended her hand,
      "My name is Amanda Dickinson.... Your father and I were really good
      friends." Her smile grew somber all of a sudden. "You may say that I
      wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him."</para>

      <para>Hostility had been replaced by a deep curiosity. "When did you
      meet my father? Where did you meet? Do you know what happened to
      him?"</para>

      <para>The woman took a deep breath, as if searching her memory for the
      concrete events. "I was with the USO crew towards the end of the Invid
      and Robotech Masters' mop-up. We went everywhere there were REF troops
      stationed... this was around 25 years ago..." Her voice trailed off as
      she began her story.</para>

      <literallayout class="normal">
<emphasis role="bold">Field Headquarters</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">Planet GSC 19475290</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">Christmas Eve, 2065</emphasis></literallayout>

      <para>There was a beehive of activity on the filed headquarters,
      knicknamed "camp rhino" by the troops. The destroids and Cyclones were
      out en force, trying to clear up an unexpected nest of Robotech Masters
      on time for Christmas dinner. Word had come down from the base commander
      that there was a USO crew en route for a Christmas concert.</para>

      <para>The shuttle came up with a heavy escort of Veritech Fighters...
      sure as hell we didn't want anything to happen to our USO crew. Lt.
      Wayne Anderson was flying escort for the shuttle as it came to land on
      camp rhino.</para>

      <para>Damn, thought Anderson as he saw the female USO troopers come out
      of the shuttle. There was one that caught Anderson's attention more than
      any other.... She was an almost-copper red headed girl with long hair
      falling below her waist and with big eyes that seemed to take everything
      in and yet seemed to have a sadness about them.</para>

      <para>As they landed, the veritechs were ordered to hold their positions
      while the shuttle disembarked their passengers. Colonel Walker, the
      commading officer of the camp welcome the USO crew and offered out
      hospitality... only to find out that part of the crew would be missing
      until the following day due to a logistics snafu but that the rest of
      the group would be more than ready to perform that night as
      planned.</para>

      <para>Damn, thought Anderson. I think I have the last patrol for the
      night and I'm gonna miss the concert. He walked to the flight tower to
      check on the schedule. As he was going to the tower, he bumped into some
      of the USO crew; among them the mysterious stranger.</para>

      <para>Ensgin Kennedy, the Public Affairs officer assigned to them,
      greeted us and instroduced me to the USO crew: A blond and outgoing
      caucasian woman named Barbara Ann Paulsen; A very seductive african
      american woman named Eileen Baker; my mistery woman, Amanda Dickinson;
      and the rest of their band and the road manager.</para>

      <para>I escorted them to our dinning hall where the began setting up for
      the concert. As the band got ready to play the girls asked for a tour of
      the camp. I didn't think to question why they wanted to see the camp,
      but thought it'd be a good opportunity to get to know them
      better.</para>

      <para>I learnt a lot about the girls on that first tour of the base. I
      learned that Barbara Ann wanted to return to Earth to a career in
      Broadway-style musicals and that she got her name from parents who were
      fans of the Beach Boys and their music. I learned that Eileen was a
      famous model and that she had put her career on hold to help out on the
      war effort. Amanda remained strangely quiet during the tour that was cut
      short when my wingman and I were called to our patrol.</para>

      <para>Take off was unusual; we had spectators. The girls were allowed
      into the control tower to see how things were done on the field. My
      wingman and I, I have to admit it, showed off by doing a formation take
      off.</para>

      <para>To say that it was hell would be the understatement of the year.
      As soon as we approached the area, the Bioroids and Zentraedi pods
      started attacking. I ordered my team to separate the Legioss and to
      cover the assault team.</para>

      <para>I've been in combat for more than 15 years and I can tell you that
      it was awful. Our objective ended up being a downed Zentraedi destroyer
      that had more firepower than everything we had back on camp rhino. It
      had to be stopped and it had to be stopped now.</para>

      <para>"This is lead, all fighters open fire on primary." I ordered as I
      opened fire with everything I had.</para>

      <para>"Aw, shit..." one of the pilots said over the tactical net. I
      turned my eyes to the target and understood the frustration... the
      target was undamaged and still pouring bioroids and pods. I also
      realized that there was only one other legioss that had stayed with me
      on the attack run.</para>

      <para>"Lead to group. Return to base. Repeat, all fighters return to
      base." I saw no point in risking my men's lives in a suicide run.</para>

      <para>The fire only intensified as we egressed the area. I felt ping
      noises coming from somewhere on the air frame. For some reason I didn't
      think I was going to make it as I ordered my Beta pilot to do a visual
      check of my fighter.</para>

      <para>"Lead, this is two." 1st Lt. Clement "Wizard" Martin reported over
      the tac net</para>

      <para>"Two, this is lead. How bad is it?" I replied, getting more tense
      by the second."</para>

      <para>Wizard took a long time in replying which made me nervous. Either
      Wizard was trying to be as careful as he ever was or the damange was far
      worse than I had thought. "Lead, this is two.... One of your engines is
      shot to hell, the rest of the craft seems like it's going to make
      it."</para>

      <para>Armed with this information I contacted the control tower. "White
      Castle, this is Badger lead, flight of 4. I've been hit and am returning
      to base on one engine. Request priority emergency landing."</para>

      <para>* * *</para>

      <para>Anderson's voice filtered to the control tower, where all the
      people there stopped what they were doing and turned towards the flight
      controller handling the landing.</para>

      <para>"Badger Leader, this is White Castle. Roger on your damage report.
      Do you think you can make it back in one piece?" The controller was
      surprisingly calm...</para>

      <para>"That's a roger, White Castle." Anderson's voice was also calmer
      than it should have been, Amanda thought with growing aprehension.
      Anderson's voice broke into the channel again, "Otherwise it'll be a
      good time to see if the ejection system works as they told us it
      would."</para>

      <para>"The landing strip is clear, Badger Leader. You can land when
      ready." The controller mutted the microphone and told a fellow
      controller. "Have the emergency crews standing by, I don't think
      Anderson is going to make it."</para>

      <para>Amanda ran out of the control tower, the better to see the
      approaching fighters land. The first three fighters, 1 alpha and 2
      betas, landed with no problem but, as soon as the second alpha fighter
      came for final approach, the emergency crews began to get ready.... as
      if they were expecting a catastrophe.</para>

      <para>"Lead, this is two... your starboard engine housing is coming
      appart. Recommend you eject." Wizard's voice showed the concern that was
      on his mind. "Negative, Wizard.... I'll take the lady down on as few
      pieces as I can." Anderson's mind was set... this fighter had saved him
      from more than one certain death episode and he was going to be damned
      if he jumped out before he did everything he could to save it.</para>

      <para>As the alpha bearing the squadron commander's mark lined up for
      landing, Amanda could see the damange and wondered how had it made it so
      far. The craft flew slower and slower as the pilot struggled to keep it
      on a proper landing glide....</para>

      <para>The Alpha came crashing down the landing strip and gunning towards
      the safety net. Suddenly, the plane's landing gear collapsed making a
      screeching sound as it ran down the landing strip. Somehow, the plane
      stopped shortly before crashing into the net.</para>

      <para>A group of rescue workers ran to the damaged craft Anderson came
      out of the plane and ran as fast as he could away from it as the crews
      covered with fire retardant.</para>

      <para>Amanda covered her face so no one would see her tears. Anderson
      walked towards her and asked, "Are you alright, Ms. Dickinson." Amanda
      just turned away and began running to her quarters.</para>

      <para>* * *</para>

      <para>The officer's club was jam packed that night. I pitied the poor
      folks that would have to remain at the posts during the concert. The
      girls had changed into their show costumes and I have to admit that if
      they looked hot before they looked scalding now.</para>

      <para>Barbara Anne began signing and old song by another female lead
      band; Heart. As the first chords of All I Want To Do Is Make Love To You
      started playing, I felt like I was back home, enjoying time with my wife
      and kid instead of being in the middle of nowhere lookng at woman whom
      I'd probably never see again.</para>

      <para />

      <literallayout class="normal">
It was a rainy night when he came into sight
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat 
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride 
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while 
I didn't ask him his name, this lonelyboy in the rain 
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight 
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night

All I wanna do is make love to you 
Say you will you want me too 
All I wanna do is make love to you 
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well 
We made magic that night. 
Oh, he did everything right 
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily 
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note 
I told him I am the flower you are the seed 
We walked in the garden we planted a tree 
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare 
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there</literallayout>

      <para />

      <para>As they eyes crossed for a second, Wayne cound see a deep pain in
      Amanda's eyes. It was there for a second and then it was gone.</para>

      <literallayout class="normal">All I wanna do is make love to you 
One night of love was all we knew

We made love Love like strangers 
All night long 
We made love

Then it happened one day, we came round the same way 
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes 
I said please, please understand 
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me 
Was the one little thing that you can

One night of love was all we knew</literallayout>

      <para />

      <para>As the music ended, Amanda ran out of the room as Ensign Kennedy
      began singing As Time Goes in a voice that I had never heard him before
      and few people have heard since.</para>

      <literallayout class="normal">This day and age we're living in 
Gives cause for apprehension 
With speed and new invention 
And things like fourth dimension 
Yet we get a trifle weary 
With Mr. Einstein's theory 
So we must get down to earth at times
Relax relieve the tension 
And no matter what the progress 
Or what may yet be proved 
The simple facts of life are such 
They cannot be removed

You must remember this 
A kiss is still a kiss 
A sigh is just a sigh 
The fundamental things apply 
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo 
They still say, "I love you" 
On that you can rely 
No matter what the future brings 
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs 
Never out of date 
Hearts full of passion 
Jealousy and hate 
Woman needs man 
And man must have his mate 
That no one can deny

Well, it's still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by 
Oh yes, the world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by</literallayout>

      <para />

      <para>I didn't wait for the song to finish before going after Amanda. I
      was starting to be really worried about her. When I finally caught up
      with her, she had a gun pointed to her head and was getting ready to
      fire.</para>

      <para>"I would not do that if I were you Ms. Dickinson." Wayne
      Anderson's voice was calm as he extended his hand to get the weapon from
      her.</para>

      <para>Amanda shook her hand away and laughed bitterly... "Don't you try
      to get the gun off my hand Lt. otherwise one of us will get hurt..."
      Amanda's body shook with sobs and her hand started shaking...</para>

      <para>The REF officer was quick on getting the gun away from her hand
      and tossing it away from her. He hugged her while she fought him, still
      trying to get the gun. "Whatever your problem is, it won't be solved by
      shooting yourself."</para>

      <para>Amanda collapsed on Wayne's arms sobbing uncontrollably. After
      several minutes of her crying and sobing, Amanda turned around and
      looked at Wayne with a smile on her face.... She moved her face closer
      to his and closed her eyes as she kissed him for a long time.</para>

      <para>* * *</para>

      <para>The CAG called Anderson to his office for the new mission
      briefing. Grim faces greeted him as the squadron commander, Captain
      Conrad Toyama began outlining the mission. "Well gentlemen... it looks
      like he destroyer you attacked yesterday is heading our way. We can't
      let that happen... you 4 are the only crews who have experience in the
      AV-3 for heavy bombing." He pointed to Anderson and another pilot who
      was standing there. "We want you to use the reflex warheads."</para>

      <para>The other three REF airmen and I blinked in unison. Using reflex
      weaponry on a planetary surface was considered a last resource to be
      used when no other method would keep the planet from falling on enemy
      hands. "Is the situation that bad, sir?"</para>

      <para>Toyama nodded, "We're preparing to hit them with everything we've
      got.... Non-essential personnel has already began evacuating the surface
      and will randevouz with the RSS Roy Fokker when it arrives in 48 hours.
      We just can't wait that long."</para>

      <para>Anderson nodded. "When do you want us to go?"</para>

      <para>"Mission launches in 4 hours." Captain Toyama replied, "God speed
      and happy hunting getlemen."</para>

      <para>When the pilots walked out of the briefing, a female voice called
      Wayne Anderson from his fellow pilots. It was Amanda Dickinson.</para>

      <para>"What the hell are you doing here?" Wayne asked, his voice between
      concerned and angry.</para>

      <para>"I had to see you before I left... if nothing else, just to say
      thanks." Amanda replied calmly. "I do know about your wife and son, but
      just wanted to say thanks... for everything."</para>

      <para>I was speechless as we held each other close. Suddenly she walked
      away to a waiting transport.</para>

      <para>* * *</para>

      <para>The two fighter-bombers approached the Zentraedi destroyer with
      Lt. Anderson, the mission leader, flying lead. "This is armaggedon lead
      to flight, "We're closing in expect heavy contact shortly."</para>

      <para>Pods and Bioroids were strangely absent from the ingress route to
      the target. All hell broke loose as we closed in on our target... I
      swear, we could almost walk on the laserfire coming from the ship. We
      fired everything we had... aiming for the vulnerable points revealed to
      the RDF by Zentraedi defectors after Robotech War I.</para>

      <para>"Let's get the fuck out of here," Lt. Anderson's voice was
      strained by the gravity pulling on him. The enemies were relentless as
      the laserfire criscrossed around the two bombers. Suddenly a bright
      flash of light came from my starboard quarter and, somehow, Anderson
      knew that his wingman had bought the farm.</para>

      <para>"I don't think I'll make it..." Anderson thought aloud as a bright
      light enveloped the fighter...</para>

      <para>"And that was the last time you saw him?" Wayne's initial
      hostility had been replaced by deep curiosity. This woman knew as much
      about his father as he did and he wanted to know more.</para>

      <para>"Yes... as I was leaving the planet we saw the Zentraedi/Robotech
      Masters forces overrun the base." Amanda paused for a second, "Shortly
      after that tour, I returned to earth where I got married...." Another
      pause. "I have two children of my own." Amanda's voice almost broke,
      "I've come to the wall every year since it was rebuilt as a way to tell
      your father thank you. If it hadn't been for him I would have probably
      blown my brains out and none of the wonderful life I've lived would
      never have happened."</para>

      <para>She knelt and put something in the floor below where dad's name
      was inscribed on the wall. It was a little doll of a REF Alpha
      fighter... She knelt there for a while, as if having a conversation with
      dad or something...</para>

      <para>I walked Amanda to the car, where she thanked me, kissed my cheek
      and left the mall.</para>

      <para>The squadron slowly filled into the briefing room. The mood was of
      curiosity among the nuggets and apprehension among the rest of the
      troops. The briefing officer was not our traditional intelligence
      officer, Major Clancy but another officer who had come board ship only a
      couple hours earlier along with an additional battle group to reinforce
      the Bunker Hill and its troops.</para>

      <para>The briefing room was packed. I knew or had heard from most of the
      officers present and they were indeed the creme of the creme of the REF
      fighter and naval aviation squadrons... Something big was indeed going
      to happen and I wanted to be a part of it, knowing than more likely than
      not, I would be stuck on the Bunker Hill, coordinating the squadrons
      from the attack force.</para>

      <para>I felt a pat on the back, I turned around and saw Lt. Colonel Wei
      Mei Shu, commander of VMFA-259, the Amazons. I hadn't seen her since the
      invasion of Optera where our teams were assigned to cover and
      bombardment operations... I thought she had retired and moved to her
      family's estate on Tirol, but apparently the <emphasis>Iron
      Maiden</emphasis> found military life too attractive to call it quits
      just yet.</para>

      <para>"Long time no see commander Fredericks... I thought that you had
      bought the farm." her voice was cordial yet more than a little hurt was
      evident in the statement.</para>

      <para>"The invids didn't like me so much, I didn't think you'd want to
      see me after the last time we split." I answered trying to avoid the
      issue she was forcing me to deal with. You see, Colonel Shu and me had
      been engaged about 5 years ago. I won't bore you with the details;
      enough to say that I moved out and transferred to a different ship and a
      different command.</para>

      <para>Before I could answer, another briefing officer stood up and
      walked to the podium. "I am Lt.. General Yuri Kallin, J2 for the 9th
      fleet." There was a brief pause, it is not normal for such a senior
      officer to brief a mission unless the mission was important. "I
      understand that some of you are wondering what am I doing here instead
      of Major Clancy. The truth is that we've kept this one tight because of
      its importance... we will be sending one of the battle groups present
      here to the 3rd planet of this system to engage the Invid. The second
      battle group will remain in orbit to provide support in case it's
      necessary."</para>

      <para>A fleet intelligence officer stood up and asked, "Why such a heavy
      assault force if we don't expect problems?" The question made the
      briefing officer uncomfortable. The answer made that evident, "There are
      strategic reasons that can not be discussed at this time. The mission
      launches at 0700 tomorrow, until then you are dismissed."</para>

      <para>As we filtered out of the briefing room, Wei walked towards me
      followed by another officer. "Alan, if we could have a word with you?"
      she was walking towards me with another officer. I motioned for them to
      join me as I walked to the officer's club. I motioned for them to sit
      with me as I ordered a round of drinks for everyone, "What's on your
      mind colonel Shu?" I asked as my two guests looked at each other.</para>

      <para>"Commander... we're concerned about this mission and that we're
      being sent out because of an intelligence snafu or because someone up
      the COC doesn't like us. We thought that you, as commander of the Bunker
      Hill's air group, could know something about the mission that wasn't
      communicated to us." If Wei had one fault was that she was honest as
      hell. The officer next to her spoke, "I'm Lt. Commander Gregory Olsen,
      commanding officer of VF-79. I don't usually question orders, but it is
      highly unusual to use 2 battle groups for a planetary assault mission,
      don't you think?" His tone was measured and respectful, but his concern
      mirrored my own.</para>

      <para>I thought carefully before I answered. "While I may agree with you
      in principle... we have a mission to complete," I paused and added, "But
      that doesn't mean we shouldn't keep our eyes open and stick with each
      other... I don't like this mission either, but we're soldiers and we've
      given a mission and I suggest you get your pilots on that same
      wavelength." I waited for a few minutes and then added, "If it's ok with
      you, then I'll go to my quarters; We have a hard day ahead of
      us."</para>

      <para>As I was leaving the O-Club, Wei walked after me. I tried my best
      to ignore her as I continued walking to my quarters on the tower decks
      of the Ikazuchi carrier. She put her hand on the doorknob before I could
      open it. She kissed me lightly before leaving for her own quarters. I
      stood there, not knowing what to do and, of course, I did
      nothing.</para>

      <para>The following morning found the hangars of the fleet in an
      organized chaos. As commander of the air group I had taken the lead on
      the assault mission and, not suprisingly, Lt. Col Shu had decided to
      join my force... "Attention all fighters assigned to Wing 1, This is
      werewolf leader." I called them to attention, "We'll do this as we
      briefed it yesterday, a surprise attack... do as much damage as you can
      to the Invid but don't stay down there any longer than you have
      to."</para>

      <para>As I heard the acknowledgments from the pilots under my command,
      my wingman reported unknown contacts. Game time was on. "Heads up, we
      have unknown contacts... Stick to your wingmen and hit hard." As an
      afterthought I added, "Happy hunting."</para>

      <para>As we moved to engage the unknowns, who I was sure were several
      hundred Invid troopers and schock troopers, I got my first surprise.
      "Attention all fighters, this is Angel, we have several thousand Invid
      mecha closing on us from the 4th planet. Attack Wing 2, move to
      intercept... Wing 1 proceed with the attack." Wei's words came to hunt
      me as I dove in on my first pass against the enemy units.</para>

      <para>If you've been in one battle, then you know what we went through.
      The invid were tireless and deadly as they danced with our fighters in
      an endless dance of death. By the sounds coming from the tactical
      network, our brothers and sisters in the second attack wing were not
      doing much better as their requests for fire support grew larger and
      larger. I swear it wasn't an easy choice to make, but it was the right
      one. "Group 2, return to the fleet. Looks like they need you more than
      we do and you may get some enemies off our back." I added shortly
      thereafter, "Group 1, we'll continue to the planet and see what can we
      do down there." I don't remember why I gave the order, but I would
      definitely do it all over again if I had to.</para>

      <para>As we bore down on the Invid mecha, we realized that they had left
      a very thin screen deffending the planet. We bore in at a heavy price.
      One by one the squadrons of my group retreated to the Bunker Hill and
      the other ships of our fleet; it was better that way and I wonder if I
      would have done the same as a young squadron commander on my first or
      second tour.</para>

      <para>Only Wei Mei Shu and her squadron were still behind me and my boys
      as we made the atmosperic interface. What we saw when we could get our
      sensors up to speed was appaling. It seemed as if the Invids had
      massacred the settlements on the planet and then were preparing to
      completley erradicate them before we intervened... I grunted, the reason
      why we had been reinforced was now clear.</para>

      <para>"Amazon leader, this is Werewolf leader, come in," I called Wei.
      There was a long minute of silence before her voice answered, "Yes,
      commander."</para>

      <para>I noted the fear and rage in her voice but decided to ignore it
      for the time being. "We need a place to land, if things don't get
      better, we may need a place to lay low for a while." After another pause
      I heard her agreement and her orders to her Electronic Warfare Officer.
      Just when I thought couldn't get worst, the tac net broke in with even
      more bad news... "All fighters, this is Angel. The fleet has suffered
      severe damage and is beginning to retreat now. All fighters who can not
      retreat head for planetary surface; we will return for you."</para>

      <para>Several of the pilots on my group were yelling and begging for the
      ships not to leave them behind. I cut in and ordered everyone to remain
      silent unless instructed to do otherwise. I further remainded everyone
      that we were in hostile territory and that the only people we'd be able
      to count in from now on were each other. It seemed as if it worked, for
      most of the chatter was over and the formation looked more like military
      flight.</para>

      <para>I don't remember how long it was before we brought our pilots
      down. Whoever had scouted the place did a great job. There were shelters
      for the mecha and housing for the troops. However it didn't take long to
      know that there was a reason for this place to be as good as it
      was...</para>

      <para>As we were landing we heard an all-hands message from the Bunker
      Hill's senior air controller. "We're being forced to retreat with heavy
      cassualties, if you can, land on the planet and link with Commander
      Fredericks... We'll be back for you as soon as we can boys, that's a
      promise." There was a short pause, "Bunker Hill out."</para>

      <para>I looked around for any sign of people breaking down and for the
      most part, I was happy to find none. "Well, it seems that we'll be
      staying here for a while, so we may as well get comfortable." I looked
      at Wei and added, "I want us to hide the veritechs and bring the
      cyclones out, I want 4 hour patrols set up around the clock, and let's
      see if we can scrounge some extra food." Everyone nodded and went to
      follow their orders.</para>

      <para>Most of the day was boring as hell, so I took an early evening
      patrol along with 3 more pilots to explore the perimteres we had set up
      around town. A very faint sound was one of the buildings we thought we
      had already investigated. We fanned out as I ordered everybody to get
      their weapons ready.</para>

      <para>As we moved into the house, the noises were suddenly replaced by
      steps walking away from us; whoever this person or thing was, it was
      good, the steps were very faint and we could barely hear them. We chased
      the noises and grabbed the source... a child that couldn't be more than
      6 or 7 years old.</para>

      <para>I was shocked. I motioned the rest of the guards to return to
      their posts when suddenly, I heard the clicking of several guns pointed
      at me and ready to fire.</para>

      <para>The leader of the group, a woman who must not have been older than
      20, looked at my uniform and motioned for us to move. I wasn't feeling
      very happy, but decided to play along with them... for now.</para>

      <para>I was blinfolded and taken underground, we continued walking for a
      while until we arrived to the base of operations; a large abandoned
      underground intelligence base. The kids obviously knew what they were
      doing, their overwatch was great and they seemed aware and relaxed at
      the same time.</para>

      <para>I was brought into the command center where several kids were
      manning surveillance systems and monitoring the Invid presence. I was
      brought into what must have been the commander's office, the blinfold
      was taken off and I was left to wait...</para>

      <para>The door opened and I stood up, ready to charge whoever the son of
      a bitch was who had me brought here. When I saw the person, I was
      stunned. She must have been 16 at the most with stunningly long blond
      hair. She was used to being obeyed and was angry as hell. She faced me
      and smiled lightly. "Welcome, commander... I'm glad to finally make you
      acquaintance."</para>

      <para>She may as well have slapped me with a rubber chicken, I was
      surprised that she had known I was here and, even worst, that they had
      caaptured us for who knows what purpose... I stood up and asked who were
      thyey and what they were going to do with their prisoners.</para>

      <para>"Don't worry commander, we won't hurt you." Her voice matched her
      age, sweet and tender; definitely out of place in a situation like this.
      "Matter of fact we were expecting you..."</para>

      <para>"What the hell are you talking about.... What do you mean you were
      expecting us?" I was beside myself. I had no doubt that these kids were
      the children of the colonists slaughtered on the surface, but I had no
      idea how did the children got so well armed and, more important, how the
      hell had they learnt so much about military procedures?</para>

      <para>"Mom told me that you were impulsive, but never that it was this
      bad," the girl chided me. I was stunned to say the least. Who was this
      girl's mother? The mystery only grew with the additional clues that I
      got.</para>

      <para>Before I had the chance to ask, the girl opened a drawer, took a
      letter out and handed it to me. It was handwriten and addressed to me.
      The return address gave me chills... it was someone I had met briefly
      for a couple months before taking over as CAG of the Bunker Hill more
      than 6 years ago. I was ready to say something but, again, she opened
      her mout before I did.</para>

      <para>"Mom and dad died when the invid first attacked the planet. Mom
      had signed up for infantry work, to be closer to dad." The girl paused
      for a second. "They had trained women and children to provide civil
      defense in case an enemy overran mecha defenses." She paused again,
      things apparently had gotten much harder for the survivors, "The fucking
      Invid killed about half the adults on the Civil Defense Force before we
      could move down here... it looks as if they won't bother us if we don't
      bother them."</para>

      <para>I noddeed as I remembered her mother... she was a really nice
      woman; I felt a big pang of guilt at seeing how our lives had grown
      apart and how hers had ended. "What's your name? How many people do you
      have here?" I asked, having a hunch that I would like the answer.</para>

      <para>"There are about 75 children and about 25 adults, most of which
      are badly wounded." The girl grinned again, "As for my name... it's Mary
      Anne, same as my mom's." I shook my head, "This is not as safe a place
      as I would like you kids to be in. We'll take the wounded to our camp
      where our corpsmen will be able to attend to them, then we'll get you
      kids out of here."</para>

      <para>The girl shook her head as she gave me back my weapon and my
      communicator, which I promplty used to call my troops to stop the search
      I knew they would have started already. I then reported I would be
      bringing some wounded and other survivors to the camp and to be redy to
      treaty wounded people.</para>

      <para>We began the march back to the camp my group and I had set up. I
      had taken point to avoid my people shooting us to pieces before we could
      identify ourselves.</para>

      <para>When Mei and one of her pilots saw us coming she motioned her
      pilot to stay put as she walked towards me and the children. The
      children were taken to the makeshift medical post to be looked over as I
      went to talk to Wei and the other pilots.</para>

      <para>We waited as we escorted the children and the wounded adults to
      our camp, we set up perimeter patrols with the older children, who knew
      the terrain better. teamed up with one or two of our pilots, who knew
      weapons better than the kids. The first patrols were uneventful and no
      signs of Invid mecha were detected... In hindsight, I think that made us
      too complacent and made us grow careless. As more and more patrols went
      out, they began detecting more Invid activity, like they were back to
      get something for the Regent.</para>

      <para>I was walking with one of the adult survivors, a woman called
      Maria, as we ran our patrol. I have to admit it, she was a gorgeous
      woman and very easy to get along with; yet you could see the hints of
      pain and suffering on her eyes, the thousand-yard-stare so tipical in
      soldiers made me painfully aware that this girl had also gone through a
      lot of shit. I took her hand on mine as we walked... she didn't take
      hers away. Suddenly, a noise had us both scrambling for cover as drew
      our weapons out.</para>

      <para>2 cougars and a scrim inorganic were closing in on our position. I
      motioned for Maria to stay put as I tried to move closer to see if those
      where the only enemy units in the area.</para>

      <para>I've been told several times that God looks over fools, then I
      must be one of the biggest fools around, because I don't know how it was
      that the inorganics didn't catch me. I stood frozen for several minutes
      as the enemy units moved away from us while we were holding our breaths
      praying for a miracle... noting happened so I guess we did get our
      miracle</para>

      <para>The news were not so good back at the camp. A schock trooper was
      engaged with 2 of our patrols and inorganic reinforcements were
      converging on our positions who, according to plan, were falling back
      towards the camp.</para>

      <para>I sighed deeply as I ordered all cyclones ready for combat and the
      defensive positions prepared. The enemy was closing in and I shouted for
      all civilians and half of the REF warriors to take cover inside our
      inner defenses.</para>

      <para>The rest of us went to our first deffensive zone and prepared for
      the inevitable... as we positioned oursevelves for combat, I wondered
      about Mary Anne's mother... about the people in the camp and the courage
      they had shown... and about the things I wish I could have done in life
      before dying; because I was positive I was going to die here
      today.</para>

      <para>A voice broke off my meditations... When I opened my eyes I saw
      Mei and another member of her squaron on their Cyclones as they blasted
      the cougars who had me trapped. I threw a quick salute and then ordered
      all remaining warriors to retreat... we were all running low on
      ammunition and I needed to see for myself that the defenses we put
      together were indeed working.</para>

      <para>My aprehension grew more and more as we moved closer to the camp.
      Apparently the enemy had somehow found our main hideout and had attacked
      en masse; we could see the bodies and scraps of Invid machines laying
      the battlefield of our headquarters. My fighters had held up and
      fulfilled their duties to the outmost of their capacities.</para>

      <para>I made sure that the civilians were safe... as safe as anyone
      could be under the circumstances and I brought together the surviving
      REF warriors for a brief After Action Report. The news were not
      good</para>

      <para>The invid forces was numerically superior to us, they were
      bringing more and more troops to bear on us and they were grinding us
      down little by little. I looked around at the grimy faces and asked, "Is
      there anyone here who thinks we shouldn't deffend this people to the
      end?" Silent nods and a few grumbles where all the answer I needed. I
      ordered people to rest and to get ready for actions. Little I knew
      action would be quick to come</para>

      <para>The patrols reported a heavy concentration of invid forces coming
      our direction. I ordered all warriors, and all civilians capable of
      fighting, to take positions around the defensive perimters. If the damn
      Invid wanted us, I'd make sure that it would cost them dearly.</para>

      <para>The attack commenced on earnest. The faster scouts and Cougar
      inorganics came first, followed by Odeon and Scrim inorganics and scouts
      and troopers. The battle was as fierce as any I've been involved in...
      Cyclone armored troopers battling hand-to-hand with cougars long enough
      to give civilians the chance to flee.</para>

      <para>A loud scream came from my right.... I looked towards the scream
      and saw Wei Mei Chu being torn to shreds by two cougars. I ran to her
      and destroyed the atacking machines, I slowlly cradled Mei's body down
      to the ground as I frantically tried to get some combat paramedics to
      us.</para>

      <para>Her voice was barely audible above the sounds of comba and death.
      "I am not going to make it Alan... I can feel it." Her body convulsed as
      the coughing got progressively worse.</para>

      <para>I hugged her lightly, afraid that everything would end in this
      cursed planet. I closed my eyes and said, "I'm sorry things didn't work
      the way we wanted to..." Mei's barely shook her head as she said,
      "There's nothing either of us could have done... that's the way life
      unfolded and I don't think we can do much about it... but I'm glad to
      have been with you at the end." With that she died...</para>

      <para>Something snapped inside of me... I had never known that such rage
      was possible yet welcome and refreshing. Someone who had been very close
      to me and whom I had been stupid enough to loose had just died and
      someone was going to pay for it. I don't remember much of what happened
      after she died. From what I'm told I accounted for more than 13 enemy
      units both, living and inorganic, before the cavalry arrived.</para>

      <para>The forces under my commands were relieved of our guard and
      defense duties later that day and the people on-planet threw up a great
      party. I walked away until I could no longer hear them... wasn't feeling
      on much of a party mood.</para>

      <para>I heard the steps way before the voice asked if she was
      interrupting. I shook my head and motioned for the person to come into
      the clearing. I was suprissed to see it was Mary Anne, the daughter of
      my old friend. "Are you OK commander?" She asked, some concern in her
      voice.</para>

      <para>I looked at her and smiled slowly. "I guess I will be... some
      day."</para>

    <partintro>
      <para>These stories have the greatest meaning for me and I hope dearly
      that I can make them justice in writing. This stories are based on the
      Sentinels campaign that I run with my RPG group in Chile. Chapter 2
      deserves special mention: It was a one-night adventure run by Diego
      Lopez and myself as part of the campaign... Perhaps the term campaign is
      a little too strong, let's say that they are adventures and experiences
      in a shared universe</para>

      <para>The stories roughly parallel the Sentinel novels with some major
      differences. The plenipotentiary council authorized the creation of a
      special task force to help defend Tirol and outliying systems from Invid
      attacks;The Hunters, Sterlings and the other major characters have more
      freedom of movement as far as traveling to and from Tirol is
      concerned... and others that I'll let you figure out on your own
      :)</para>

      <para>Certain people deserve special thanks for the ideas and the
      stories that happen in this chapter: Diego "lucky 207" Lopez, then,
      womanizer extraodinaire who knew half the women on the REF very well;
      Cristian "Johnny" Garnham the voice of sanity in this nuts universe,
      both real and fictional; Gabriel Diaz fellow player and the one who
      introduced D &amp; D to the crowd and Cristian "jester" Vieira, the
      biggest SOB who lives from here to Tirol.</para>

        <para>And in other news today, admirals Rick and Lisa Hayes-Hunter
        have authorized the creation of an experimental task force to improve
        REF defenses. Command of the task force has been awarded to Major
        General Alexander Sinclair, a former RDF and Southern Cross veritech
        pilot and military intelligence specialist. No further information is
        available at this time, but it's rumored that Justine Huxley and other
        members of the plenipotentiary council will formally announce this new
        fighting force later today</para>

        important than we ever thought possible, and his force will cut our
        strength by 25%. Yet I'm positive that Sinclair and his troops will do
        well I flew with him and I know what he's capable of. I just hope I
        won't find the hard way that my trust was misplaced.</para>

      <para />

      <para />

      <para>"There is no way that a former Southern Cross veritech pilot will
      be given command of such a force, Admiral," T.R. Edwards said as he sat
      down. The members of the plenipotentiary council looked around the
      conference room and then at each other.</para>

      <para>Admiral Hunter stood. He was never an imposing sight, but his
      leadership abilities and his dedication to his men had won him the trust
      of all the officers and enlisted members of the Expeditionary Force.
      "Colonel Edwards, if I may add something" Hunter fixed his opponent with
      a penetrating look that was returned with as much intensity.</para>

      <para>"Certainly, sir." Edwards replied as he sat down as he looked at
      Hunter with venom in his eyes.</para>

      <para>"Thank you. While it's true that General Sinclair served part of
      his career in the Armies of the Southern Cross, we can't forget that the
      rest of his career was in the Robotech Defense Force." Hunter looked at
      the members of the council and added, "Alexander Sinclair has served
      with utmost distinction and courage through the Robotech War and the
      malcontent uprisings He is the best man for the job."</para>

      <para>Edwards was ready to reply but Hunter ignored him as he continued,
      addressing the council members this time. "The last thing that we need
      right now is a fight over who will lead the force. I have no doubt that
      Colonel Edwards would love to be assigned as its leader, but the truth
      is that we need him here in Tirol to help coordinate our overall
      defenses against the Invid." Hunter paused again and gave the only
      military officer who was not a member of the council a reassuring
      grin.</para>

      <para>Justin Huxley, a former judge and now a member of the REF
      plenipotentiary council cleared her throat and stood. "Gentlemen, this
      debate is not leading to anything productive and I'm afraid that we have
      no time to loose." She turned to Hunter and the man sitting next to him,
      "Admiral Hunter, General Sinclair; the 28th REF Defense Task Force is
      hereby authorized by the Plenipotentiary Council. You will have as much
      resources as we can spare you."</para>

      <para>Sinclair tried no to smile, but he found it hard not to do so.
      After years of Southern Cross service, he was again where he felt he
      belonged and from where he should have never left in the first
      place.</para>

      <para>Another council member's voice broke the former T.A.S.C
      commander's reverie. "General Sinclair, Has a site for your base been
      selected?"</para>

      <para>For the first time since the meeting started Sinclair stood. He
      was not short, standing at 6'-2" yet it was not his height but his
      innate charisma the first thing people noticed. "Yes, sir. We've
      selected the Aquaria system for our headquarters and we'll be creating a
      number of re-supply bases for our forces."</para>

      <para>Edwards stood up, shouting this time, "That is insane according to
      the records left by the Robotech Masters, that system is very vulnerable
      to Invid attack!"</para>

      <para>Sinclair agreed. "Yes, Colonel, you're right. That is precisely
      the reason why we decided to set up our headquarters there. The Aquaria
      system gives us access to 14 systems that we can defend or attack at
      will."</para>

      <para>Before Edwards could riposte, Admiral Hunter intervened, "As Judge
      Huxley said, we have no time for bickering the task force is approved
      and its formation will be started immediately. I expect your full
      cooperation Colonel do I make myself clear?"</para>

      <para>Edwards nodded silently, his eyes a mask of cold and blind
      rage.</para>

      <para>As the meeting broke up, Rick Hunter approached Sinclair and
      asked, "Would you have dinner with Lisa and me tonight, General?"
      Sinclair nodded, "It'll be my pleasure, sir."</para>

      <para>As they walked toward the captain's quarters that Rick and Lisa
      Hayes-Hunter shared aboard the Super Dimensional Fortress, Alexander
      Sinclair reflected briefly on the turn of events that his life had
      taken. He had enlisted on the RDF shortly after the SDF-1 landing and
      had been assigned to the Diamondback Veritech squadron.</para>

      <para>Shortly After LCDR Foker's death he had been reassigned to the
      Skull Veritech squadron under the command of the new Veritech Division
      Commander, one Lt. Rick Hunter. A strange kind of friendship developed
      between the team commander and the new member of the squadron, a
      friendship that lasted through Robotech War I and well into the
      malcontent years.</para>

      <para>Sinclair decided to join the Armies of the Southern Cross because
      of the alarmingly low number of officers with combat experience in the
      outfit. Sinclair rose quickly through the Southern Cross' ranks. He
      could have had any Southern Cross TASC command that he wanted, but his
      loyalty to Admiral Rick Hunter titled the odds in favor of his joining
      the Pioneer mission to Tirol so they could face the Masters on their
      backyard.</para>

      <para>"And not this trip has ended with me having a major command in the
      REF and having dinner with the two top military leaders of this entire
      outfit," thought Sinclair. "Either I've been very lucky or I'm paying
      Karma at a vastly accelerated rate."</para>

      <para>As they came into the Captain quarters on the SDF-3's command
      level, Admiral Hayes-Hunter came out of her office and smiled widely.
      "Congratulations on your new command, General." Hayes hadn't changed
      much since the last time Sinclair had seen her; back when the now
      husband and wife were playing their love hate game she still looked
      beautiful.</para>

      <para>"Thank you ma'am I only hope I prove worthy of the trust you and
      Admiral Hunter have put on me." Sinclair was s uddenly reminded of the
      tremendous job and responsibility that had been trust upon him.</para>

      <para>"Nonsense Alex. I think you know me well enough to realize that I
      would have never assigned you to this post if I had any doubt about your
      abilities." Interrupted Hunter. "The truth is that I couldn't find
      anyone better suited to this command than you. Believe me, Lisa, Breetai
      and I did look everywhere."</para>

      <para>Sinclair drank the offered glass of wine and thought about what he
      had just been told. After a long silence, Admiral Hunter added, "To a
      successful mission General."</para>

      <para>They lifted their glasses, "To a successful mission."</para>

      <para>The rest of the dinner was quiet, with only the reminiscing of
      good old times spent together in the SDF-1 and the space platforms
      interrupting the meal. Sinclair didn't want to stay too long so he
      excused himself and walked over to the operations center and looked for
      Colonel Patricia Williams.</para>

      <para>Sinclair knocked on Colonel William's door and came in when told
      to do so.</para>

      <para>"Patricia, I have news" began Sinclair before she put a finger on
      his mouth and quietly said, "I know, the task force was authorized and
      you have to start working on it immediately. Operations got the word
      before the announcement."</para>

      <para>They looked at each other nobody spoke for what seemed to be an
      eternity. He broke the silence; "I want you to come to Aquaria with me
      Patricia I know it'll be hard but we'll manage to work it out."</para>

      <para>She shook her head, "Alex, I've already been assigned to
      Operations on the SDF-3 with a possible promotion to one-star." She
      looked at her boyfriend again, "That's what we both wanted, wasn't it
      Alex?"</para>

      <para>Sinclair stood and started walking towards the door as he spoke,
      "You're right Trish. I'm sorry for having been so selfish I hope that
      everything works out for you and that you drop by Aquaria occasionally.
      I would certainly love to see you from time to time." He opened the door
      and walked out of her quarters.</para>

      <para>Williams ran to the door calling his name but he didn't turn
      around.</para>

      <para>Major General Sinclair surveyed the terrain and wondered, "How the
      hell did I get myself into this?" Sinclair had been selected to command
      the task force by Admirals Hunter and Hayes-Hunter and Commander
      Breetai. He had never thought that it would be such strenuous
      work.</para>

      <para>Several people walked towards Sinclair who, even in light summer
      uniform, could easily recognize them: Colonel Amanda Hendricks was
      assigned as commander of the REF Aerospace Forces' contingent assigned
      to the unit. Colonel Alan Chadwick, the commander of the REF Marine
      Corps units attached to the 28th. Vice Admiral Robert Taylor, commander
      of the Task Force's REF Naval contingent. Finally, there was Brigadier
      General Paul Dickson, commander of the REF Army forces."</para>

      <para>The other two officers were two of Sinclair's field commanders.
      Brigadier Generals Steve Connors, commander of Task Group 28.2 and
      second in command of the task force, and Michael Cameron, Commander of
      Task Group 28.3.</para>

      <para>"Status report?" asked Sinclair as soon as the people were within
      hearing distance.</para>

      <para>Colonel Hendricks was the first one to reply. "A bare bones air
      field has been set up and the supply ships are starting to bring the
      rest of our equipment. We're good to go sir."</para>

      <para>All reports were similar. The initial forces assigned to
      Sinclair's command were setting up their shops. Sinclair then turned to
      his field commanders and asked, "How is Mountain Home coming,
      Steve?"</para>

      <para>"We've got all the pieces in place, the orbital construction crews
      have already started working we should be ready by the target date."
      Replied the task force's first officer.</para>

      <para>"How are the task groups coming Mike?" Sinclair asked the last of
      his officers</para>

      <para>"We'll reach IOC (Initial Operation Capability) in 2 months, as
      soon as the last of the Cruisers assigned to us complete their shakedown
      cruises after refit. One thing's for sure: We'll have a lot of work to
      do." Was the answer.</para>

      <para>"Well, lady and gentlemen You've all done a wonderful job. Please
      pass a "well done" to the troops. Are there any questions?" There was a
      short-lived silence. "Dismissed."</para>

      <para>As the officers left, Sinclair turned back to the construction
      site for the new Henry J. Gloval base and wondered what the future would
      be bringing for all the people who had trusted their lives to
      him.</para>

      <para>"What do you mean that the micronians are on Tirol," an angry
      female voice demanded.</para>

      <para>"The Robotech Masters had left the planet before the micronians
      arrived. According to out spies, these same micronians made Breetai and
      his troops defect. They even saw Exedore and Breetai in the micronian
      uniforms." A male aide replied.</para>

      <para>The female commander looked at her aide for several minutes the
      masters were gone and micronians were in the Master's homeworld.</para>

      <para>"Instruct the rest of the fleet to prepare for combat I think it's
      time we test these micronians' strength." The commander instructed and
      then added, as if in an afterthought, "Also instruct your spies to start
      causing some problems for the people of Tirol. Let's see how well they
      can deal with a little combat stress."</para>

      <para>"Per your command, sir." The aide said before leaving to complete
      his orders.</para>

      <para>This certainly will be interesting, thought the commander and her
      laughter filled the room.</para>

      <para>As the band finished their music, Admiral Rick Hunter, Admiral
      Lisa Hayes-Hunter and Commander Breetai came off the shuttle. General
      Sinclair and his command staff were waiting for them to greet them and
      escort them on a tour of the Aquaria facilities.</para>

      <para>"It looks like all the work you've put into this project is
      bearing fruits, General. These facilities look great." Hunter whispered.
      "Last time you were in Tirol I forgot to ask how is Colonel Williams
      doing?"</para>

      <para>The question hit Sinclair with the force of a physical blow. He
      shook his head several times before answering, "I don't know, sir. I
      haven't seen her since the night we had dinner together at Tirol." He
      then avoided the Admiral's questioning gaze and added, "The last thing I
      knew was that she had been assigned to Operations on the SDF-3 and that
      she was in line for promotion to Brigadier General."</para>

      <para>Hunter nodded slowly but didn't say a word as the car continued
      the tour. The car came to a halt outside the civilian city attached to
      the base where another band was waiting and more ceremonies were
      scheduled to happen.</para>

      <para>Once the band had finished playing and the speeches were done
      with, the group walked to the main command center where Admiral Hunter
      made the activation broadcast. "This is Aquaria command to all ships in
      the area Aquaria is now an operational base repeat, Aquaria is an
      operational base."</para>

      <para>After the ceremony was concluded Sinclair invited his commanders
      to a formal dinner to be held at the officer's club on the base.</para>

      <para>The dinner broke up into little conversation groups. Breetai
      walked to Sinclair and the Hunters. "You've set up a nice base here
      General" The Zentraedi commented, "some of my people would like to be
      stationed here, if that's ok with you."</para>

      <para>Sinclair looked up and nodded; "If that's ok with Admiral Hunter I
      see no problem with it, sir." The commander of the Task Force was not
      short, but the Zentraedi towered over him.</para>

      <para>The conversation took other bearings, much to Sinclair's relief. A
      large percentage of the REF's Zentraedi contingent had volunteered to be
      returned to their original size in order to mine monopole ore needed for
      the space fold drives of the new fleet. Exedore and those Zentraedi
      assigned to other units of the REF would remain micronized for as long
      as they wanted or until they were needed.</para>

      <para>Sinclair then asked about his request for Robotechnologist to
      staff a small R&amp;D facility in Aquaria. Hunter answered that Dr. Lang
      had approved reluctantly, but one of the transfers suggested that it
      would free people to conduct more weapons' research than it would be
      possible in Tirol. Sinclair nodded again, relieved that Lang had agreed
      with his idea. Now he could contact the people he had in mind for his
      Research Center.</para>

      <para>The formal dinner broke up shortly after as the Hunters left and
      the rest of the participants broke up into smaller groups to continue
      the gossip and discussion.</para>

      <para>Sinclair walked outside and sat in the balcony, looking at the
      stars over the base's facilities. "I didn't mean to upset you general,"
      a voice broke Sinclair's contemplation.</para>

      <para>"You didn't, sir," Sinclair was quick to answer even as Hunter
      shook his head.</para>

      <para>"Remember what you told me the last time we saw each other before
      Khyron's attack?" Hunter asked, changing the conversation in a
      surprising way.</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded grimly. The last day before Khyron's attack he and
      Hunter had been talking over a drink at the New Macross officers' club
      about love and relationships in general. Sinclair had mentioned that he
      and Commander Hayes seemed to be playing the game of cat and mouse on
      purpose. There was a long silence after which Hunter promptly left,
      without answering the question.</para>

      <para>"Are you implying that I'm acting the same way, skipper?" Sinclair
      asked without answering his C.O's question.</para>

      <para>"Yes I am implying that you're doing the same thing that Lisa and
      I did while we were still in Macross." Hunter answered with a smile on
      his face.</para>

      <para>Sinclair didn't answer for a long time. What his former commander
      had said touched something deep inside him. "I'll think about what you
      just told me, sir. I definitely will."</para>

      <para>Hunter nodded, "That's all I ever wanted to hear, General. Have a
      good night."</para>

      <para>"You too, Admiral." With that Hunter went back to his
      quarters.</para>

      <para>Sinclair looked around once again and wondered what the hell was
      that conversation about, but only briefly, before returning his gaze to
      the stars.</para>

      <para>"General Sinclair, there's a personal message from Brigadier
      General Patricia Williams directed to you sir." The corporal manning the
      communication station said over his private mike.</para>

      <para>"Thank you Mr. Livermore, I'll take it in my ready room." Said
      Sinclair as he walked to his ready room, just outside the command
      center. He answered the call as he sat down on his desk the image on the
      screen left him speechless.</para>

      <para>"Hi Alex. Long time no see." Patricia's voice had a strange,
      almost playful, tone to it. "I just wanted to let you know that I was
      reassigned to Aquaria and that I should be arriving onplanet in about 16
      hours."</para>

      <para>Sinclair didn't know what to say and, to his own ears, the answer
      sounded fake. I'll be waiting for you at Mountain Home... You are more
      than welcome to stay with me when you arrive just like old
      times."</para>

      <para>When the General returned to the command center his face had a
      smile on it and his step had a spring to it that surprised the people in
      the command center consoles. Suddenly, Sinclair said, "Communications,
      please announce Mountain Home that I'll be conducting an inspection tour
      of the station in 2 hours," as he walked towards the elevator.</para>

      <para>As General Sinclair arrived on the Station, he received a message
      from the Station Comm Officer who informed him that the RSS Gettysburg
      was leaving Tirol and that the ETA was approximately 12 hours.</para>

      <para>Sinclair acknowledged the message from the observation deck where
      he was receiving reports from different units stationed aboard the
      station as a "first line of defense."</para>

      <para>As Sinclair heard the reports, he began to wonder if things were
      stating to get better. Suddenly an alert message came over the PA
      system, "Attention all alert crews. The RSS Gettysburg is under attack
      by unknown forces this is not a drill, repeat, this is not a
      drill."</para>

      <para>Sinclair began to run to the elevator. He stopped before getting
      to the elevator and yelled, "Have the alert ship stand by for me I'll be
      joining them shortly."</para>

      <para>As Sinclair walked in to the RSS Wolf's Den's command bridge the
      helmsman called, "We're ready to leave sir, commencing undocking
      procedures." The Ikazuchi's captain looked at the arriving general and
      awaited for command.</para>

      <para>"You're in command Captain, I'll be stealing one of you fighters
      once we arrive at the coordinates of the Gettysburg's last
      transmission." Sinclair said as he started running to the elevator once
      more.</para>

      <para>15 minutes later the ship had defolded and the first squadron of
      veritech fighters had launched off the Ikazuchi carrier and accelerated
      towards the combat zone. General Sinclair took command of the first
      group of Veritechs.</para>

      <para>Werewolf leader, this is werewolf 6. I have unidentified contacts
      straight ahead surrounding the Gettysburg sir." A young Lt. reported in
      shortly before Sinclair got the information on his radar screen.</para>

      <para>"Attention all werewolves. This is lead" Called the general.
      "You're cleared to engage as you see fit but remember, our main priority
      is to protect the Gettysburg."</para>

      <para>The Alphas and Betas of Sinclair's squadron accelerated to attack
      speed as they closed on the Gettysburg and its attackers.</para>

      <para>Several pilots called about the attacker's identity over the
      tac-net. "This is werewolf 12 My scanners show 3 Regult Tactical Battle
      Pods and 3 Raulon've Fighter Pods." Sinclair's own scanners confirmed
      the call</para>

      <para>"What the hell are Zentraedi doing here?" was all Sinclair had
      time to think before he engaged a new group of enemy pods.</para>

      <para>As suddenly as they had appeared, the Zentraedi warriors were
      gone. A controller's voice came in from the Wolf's Den; "Attention all
      fighters, this is Rampage, enemy forces are withdrawing. All wolves
      return to the den, repeat, all wolves return to the den."</para>

      <para>"You heard the lady, gentlemen. Let's head home. Damage reports?"
      said Sinclair as he banked his fighter to return to his
      mothership.</para>

      <para>Fortunately for Sinclair forces, the damage was minimal. All
      fighters returned safely to the Ikazuchi carrier.</para>

      <para>As General Sinclair returned to the bridge, he said "Mr. Davis,
      patch me through to Mountain Home and Gloval Base in Aquaria please."
      The watch officer at both places came online shortly after. As Sinclair
      completed his report they blinked several times and said that it was
      impossible.</para>

      <para>"Gentlemen, I have at least 8 positive scanner readings indicating
      that they were indeed Zentraedi pods." Sinclair cut the watch officers'
      comments. "Upon my return to Mountain Home, please have the General
      Connors meet me in conference room 2 alpha." Sinclair then turned to the
      bridge crew and added, "Status report on the Gettysburg?"</para>

      <para>The tactical coordinator replied. "They just came in, sir.
      Gettysburg suffered heavy damage to the spacefold system and moderate
      damage to all other systems. Their chief engineer reports that they
      should have repairs completed within 10 hours for fold to
      Aquaria."</para>

      <para>The relief in Sinclair's voice was undeniable. "Stand by until
      they complete repairs and notify the Gettysburg's skipper that we will
      escort them on to Mountain Home."</para>

      <para>"Yes, sir."</para>

      <para>As the Gettysburg pulled into one of Mountain Home's repair bays.
      Sinclair surveyed the damage with his Executive officer. "It looks like
      they were playing with the ship and its veritech fighters they destroyed
      only those who got too close to breaking their line and they damaged the
      ship only enough to prevent it from escaping." General Connors
      observed.</para>

      <para>Sinclair agreed, "What worries me the most is that we though we
      had accounted for all Zentraedi forces after the destruction of Dolza's
      base. Apparently we were mistaken."</para>

      <para>Both officers observed in silence as the first crews began working
      on the damaged ship.</para>

      <para>The chime on the door sounded, General Connors said, "Enter." An
      engineering officer came into the room, stood at attention and, when
      ordered at ease, handed Sinclair a report.</para>

      <para>Sinclair read it several times before asking the officer, "How
      certain are you of this?"</para>

      <para>"We are 90% confident, sir." The engineering officer replied,
      "There is now way for the fold system to fail the way it did on the
      Gettysburg. Dr. Lang's team on Tirol verified our results five times
      before agreeing with them."</para>

      <para>"Thank you. Dismissed." Sinclair ordered.</para>

      <para>Once the engineering officer had left, Sinclair added, "Steve, see
      if you can track Commander Breetai and tell him that I request a meeting
      with him at his convenience. Someone did this and I'm not sure if there
      is a connection."</para>

      <para>The X.O. nodded and left the room.</para>

      <para>The chime on the door sounded again. Sinclair said. "Come in."
      Patricia Williams came in, her face visibly shaken by the attack on her
      ship. No one said anything for several minutes, just holding each other
      knowing that they were together.</para>

      <para>"Thank God you're OK, Trish," Sinclair broke the silence. Patricia
      remained silent, still not wanting to say anything.</para>

      <para>"Let's get you to your quarters in Aquaria. We can talk later,"
      said Sinclair as he led the way to the shuttle.</para>

      <para>General Williams' silence prolonged itself for hours upon her
      encounter with her commander. Sinclair had offered to take her to dinner
      and offer that had not changed her mood or her frightened looks. Upon
      entering Sinclair's house, however, she made her first comment. "I can't
      believe that you actually kept the plans of our house on
      Macross."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded slowly, as if afraid to bring the subject up. "It
      was the only place I could ever call home. I thought it fitting that it
      would remain so now that I've kind of settled down."</para>

      <para>Another long silence followed his last comment, neither of them
      knowing what to say as they looked at each other. Suddenly, Patricia
      said, "Thanks, Alex."</para>

      <para>Sinclair tried to hide the growing apprehension he was feeling as
      the report was completed.</para>

      <para>"We've had at least 5 reports of unknown Zentraedi forces
      attacking REF and local group's ships and planets. Plus we've had one of
      our own ships sabotaged and we don't know if there is a relation between
      the two incidents.</para>

      <para>There was a long pause, "Commander Breetai is concerned as well:
      All Zentraedi forces not assigned to Tirol have been ordered to standby
      alert." The intelligence officer continued his briefing, offering a mix
      of what he knew, what he thought he knew and what he knew that his
      Commanding Officer would want to know.</para>

      <para>Sinclair knew that as well, "Fine captain, you've told me what you
      thought I wanted to hear. Now I want to hear what you and your people
      are thinking might be happening. I'll grill you for what you know, but I
      will take responsibility for what you think you know, is that
      clear?"</para>

      <para>The intelligence officer nodded as he resumed his briefing. The
      Zentraedi attacks had been surgical, nothing like attacks they were used
      to seeing from Zentraedi forces on Earth before and during the
      malcontent uprisings.</para>

      <para>Sinclair looked around the table for an answer, "Ok, people here's
      the beef. We have a hostile Zentraedi force attacking both REF and
      Sentinels ships and planets. Correct?"</para>

      <para>Heads nodded around the room, those who had served with Sinclair
      the longest knew where this was leading and didn't like it at
      all.</para>

      <para>"Then let's find out what they are up to and where they are
      hiding, shall we? I will cancel leaves as necessary in order to get this

      <para>No one spoke. The newest officers were stunned. "Dismissed."
      Sinclair said as they stood up to leave the room.</para>

      <para>Sinclair was sitting on the command chair of his Flagship, the RSS

      <para>Sinclair turned around suddenly. "There are no other REF ships

      even as he asked.</para>

      <para>"No Sir," tactical replied, "We're the only ones scheduled to be

      <para>Sinclair nodded, his look shifting rapidly from a smile to a grim.
      "Tactical, bring us to battle stations." He turned to his comm officer
      and added, "Comm, please hail the approaching ship. Indicate that we're
      field testing a prototype and that they are not to remain in this
      area."</para>

      <para>"Sir, incoming ship has just released approximately 400 tactical

      <para>"Launch our alert patrols and prepare the Ready 5 ships; instruct
      them to launch when ready." Sinclair ordered. Then he added, "Comm, send

      <para>A second Legios formed up on Dixon's wing, just as the squadron
      skipper's voice came over the tac-net and issued his orders, "Ok boys,
      we need to protect the boat at all costs." There was a pause and then
      the commander added, "Go get 'em boys and girls."</para>

      <para>As the 2-ship elements broke up for individual engagements, Dixon
      and his wingman remained on course, loosing a volley of missiles and
      then another one before the alphas transformed to battloids while
      attached to the betas and destroyed even more of the enemy's
      pods.</para>

      <para>Slowly, almost inch-by-inch, the REF fighters drove the Zentraedi
      forces back. Apparently the Zentraedi commander was counting on that
      because the launched a second wave of battle pods, destroying several
      REF fighters and damaging even more.</para>

      <para>Aboard the Kittyhawk, General Sinclair saw, to his horror, how his
      fighters were hit. He turned to tactical and ordered, "Prepare the
      Plasma Cannon and stand by to fire."</para>

      <para>The tactical officer replied, "Sir, the cannon has not been
      certified mission ready."</para>

      <para>Sinclair turned briefly. "Prepare to fire the cannon. We have
      several hundred pilots outside and we need to do something to protect
      them."</para>

      <para>Tactical nodded, still not very convinced. "Aye sir."</para>

      <para>"Attention all Veritechs, this is Red Crown. Disengage and move at
      least 1500 kilometers away from the enemy ship. We will attempt to fire
      the main gun," came the voice of the Kittyhawk's flight boss, Commander
      Annalise Albers.</para>

      <para>"They are gonna do what?" several pilots asked over the

      <para>The squadron's commander voice came crisp over the tactical

      area."</para>

      <para>As the REF fighters cleared the area something really wonderful,
      and terrifying, happened. The bow of the Kittyhawk changed color, from
      it's standard ship-black, to yellow and then to red and then to white
      before a hot white stream launched from the Kittyhawk and leaped towards
      the Zentraedi warship, linking the two ships for the briefest of
      moments.</para>

      <para>Then the Zentraedi ship began to disintegrate, slowly at first,
      but then faster and faster. The enemy ship finally exploded in a big
      ball of plasma and protoculture.</para>

      <para>"Attention all fighters, this is Red Crown, return to base,"
      Commander Albers' voice was more relaxed now as she repeated her
      message. "This is Red Crown. All fighters return to base."</para>

      <para />

      <para>Although Sinclair had been briefed about the plasma cannon firing
      sequence, it was still a remarkable sight. Once the Zentraedi threat was
      eliminated, Sinclair turned around and asked, "Damage report?"</para>

      <para>"Everything checks sir; minimal damage to all sections. The
      Kittyhawk is ready to be certified combat worthy." The Chief Engineer's
      voice was unmistakably filled with pride. This was the first major
      project undertaken by the crews of Aquaria's scientific and technical
      communities and their success worked wonders for their reputation and
      their paychecks.</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded. Seeing his idea having become a reality also
      filled him with pride. "Good job Commander Kodama. Pass a the word to
      the troops that they did an excellent job."</para>

      <para>As the engineer left the room after saluting, two persons came
      into the room, each with a big smile on their faces and talking
      excitedly among themselves.</para>

      <para>"Good job, Paul, it feels like a dream and the helmsmen told me
      that it drives like one too." Sinclair said as the two men came to stand
      in front of him.</para>

      <para>The alluded man smiled as he nodded, "Thank you, sir. It was a
      bitch, but we finally got the lady working right." He turned to the man
      next to him and then back to Sinclair as he continued, "Alex, I would
      like to introduce Dr. Jake Simmons to you. He has an idea that I think
      we should listen to."</para>

      <para>Sinclair looked at Dr. Simmons, motioning for him to start the
      briefing.</para>

      <para>"General, I was a member of Dr. Zand's research team before the
      SDF-3 left for Tirol. We had begun work on something Dr. Zand called a
      'Singularity Effect Generator.'" Simmons paused for a second, "as the
      theory went, the system was designed as a last-defense system where all
      the enemy ships would be pulled into an artificial black hole and
      destroyed."</para>

      <para>Sinclair raised an eyebrow before asking, "And what would happen
      to the originating starship?"</para>

      <para>There was a brief silence before Simmons replied, "It was
      theorized that it would reappear after the black hole collapsed, we
      never got to field test the system. Dr. Lang considered it too
      dangerous."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded. The last Zentraedi attack had really shook the
      commander. Still he had to be careful he couldn't risk things on just a
      gamble. "Dr. Simmons, Dr. Nichols; I'm authorizing you to do a full
      study of this 'Singularity Effect Generator,' including ways to safely
      test it before installing it on any ship under my command."</para>

      <para>Both men nodded and turned around to leave.</para>

      <para>The Social Club of Freedom City was awfully crowded. Several crews

      City in addition to VOQ at Gloval base.</para>

      <para>Sinclair entered the club and smiled. It was very infrequently
      that he got to avoid official functions and enjoy himself as a pilot, as
      opposed to a flag officer. Both Sinclair and Williams had opted for
      civilian clothes. Sinclair was wearing jeans, a t-shirt and a flight
      jacket while Patricia was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. For one night
      they were just a couple and not two flag officers.</para>

      <para>The music coming through the speakers brought Sinclair back in
      time. It was an old '80s band called Miami Sound Machine and they were
      playing a song called "Hot Summer Nights." The same song that was
      playing when Sinclair and Patricia Williams had first met right before
      the SDF-1 had 'landed' on Macross Island.</para>

      <para>The couple walked to the bar, where Sinclair ordered a beer and
      Patricia ordered a soda. Sinclair looked around, wishing he could mingle
      with the crews around him as opposed to having to seat with other flag
      officers.... Sometimes</para>

      <para>Sinclair saw a familiar face in the crowd and yelled, "Hey Lopez!"
      The alluded officer turned around suddenly, saw Sinclair, and started
      walking towards him. "General Sinclair, General Williams." Lt. Colonel
      Diego Lopez saluted the officers who had called him.</para>

      <para>Sinclair returned the salute, smiled and said, "No decorum
      tonight, at least not between us... we've known each other long enough."
      He paused to look at his friend and added, "I see life has been treating
      you well, look at you, a short colonel already."</para>

      <para>Lopez nodded, "Thanks to your recommendation I was able to
      handpick the people I wanted for the Tigersharks." Lopez nodded
      appreciatively, "And you haven't done so bad yourself, this is an
      awesome place that you have here."</para>

      <para>Sinclair smiled, "We've come a long way buddy."</para>

      <para>Lt. Colonel Diego Lopez had first served under Sinclair after the
      destruction of the SDF-1 and -2 when Commander Hunter had to reorganize
      his remaining veritech forces to protect, at least, North America. Lopez
      was a wild 1st Lt. who had recently completed advanced veritech
      training. Sinclair was a recently promoted Lt. Commander who was still
      struggling with the responsibilities of command.</para>

      <para>VF-243, the Black Knights, had soon distinguished itself as on of
      the top fighting outfits on the RDF. They fought alongside Commander
      Sterling's Skull Squadron down in the Brazilian grand cannon and, later,
      aboard ARMD-23, the Akagi, stood guard against possible Zentraedi
      attacks.</para>

      <para>When Sinclair transferred to the Tactical Armored Space Corps of
      the Armies of the Southern Cross, he recommended Lopez for command of
      the angels and for promotion. They were only reunited before the Pioneer
      mission's departure. Sinclair was assigned to review the squadrons that
      would be assigned directly to the SDF-3 and saw then Diego Lopez's name
      among the roster. Per Sinclair's recommendation Lopez was allowed to
      handpick the members of his new squadron, the Tigersharks.</para>

      <para>And now he had come full circle. They were serving together again,
      and the challenge promised to be one for the record books</para>

      <para>"Alex, Patricia; may I introduce you to staff sergeant Anna
      Paulova, Military Specialist and pilot of the Tigersharks." Lopez said
      reverting to a more formal tone. "Anna, this is general Alexander
      Sinclair, commanding officer of the Task Force and General Patricia
      Williams, chief of the Logistics Command."</para>

      <para>Pleasantries were exchanged and the conversation resumed the more
      festive tone that it carried before the introductions.</para>

      <para>Several people approached the group. Sinclair looked around and
      smiled briefly before addressing the group. "What can I help you with
      gentlemen?"</para>

      <para>The leader of the group looked at Sinclair sitting in front of
      him, "Nothing you can do, but perhaps the ladies here would like to have
      some fun instead of spending time with such dour people as you."</para>

      <para>Lopez stood up and faced the group, "Do you know who you are..."
      Sinclair looked at him with a warning, but Lopez continued, "...talking
      to asshole?"</para>

      <para>Sinclair cut him in, "An officer of this task force." While saying
      this, Sinclair had also stood up and began quickly evaluating his and
      his friend's opposition.</para>

      <para>"Sure and next time you will tell me that you are the commander of
      the whole fucking task force," one of the group, who apparently had one
      drink too many added.</para>

      <para>Lopez and Sinclair looked at each other and smiled, and then they
      returned their attention to their opponents. "You have two options,
      either you leave or you get hurt," Sinclair commented in as serious a
      tone of voice as he could muster.</para>

      <para>"You sure, flyboy?" The leader of the group asked.</para>

      <para>"If I were you I wouldn't test the man." Lopez replied, "He
      punches really hard.</para>

      <para>The first punch was on its way even before Lopez had finished his
      sentence. Sinclair was expecting it, and easy avoided the punch directed
      at him while launching one of his own.</para>

      <para>The rest of the group finally decided to join his leader and began
      moving toward the two officers. Sinclair and Lopez looked at each other,
      smiled, and started walking toward their opponents.</para>

      <para>The group of men had decided to divide thing evenly, 3 went after
      each of their enemies. They started raining punches that were easily
      avoidable and, just as easy; they started falling under Lopez and
      Sinclair's counter attacks.</para>

      <para>A loud siren broke the brawl. Several Military Police officers
      came crashing into the room second later. They approached the two
      officers. "General Sinclair, are you ok sir?" The MP commander
      asked.</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, looked at his friend and added, "They just
      tripped."</para>

      <para>The MP nodded, "Yes, sir We'll take care of them."</para>

      <para>The two officers moved back to the bar and ordered a pair of beers
      for themselves as they laughed.</para>

      <para>"Just like old times, isn't it?" Asked Lopez as he took a long sip
      from his beer.</para>

      <para>"You bet. It feels so good just to be able to get into a brawl
      without having bodyguards beat the crap off the people you are brawling
      with." Sinclair replied as he led the way back to their friends.</para>

      <para>"What the hell was all that about?" Patricia asked in an
      exasperated tone of voice.</para>

      <para>"Aw. Come on, honey.... Every man has the right to have fun once
      in a while, doesn't he?" Sinclair replied in as innocent a voice as he
      could muster.</para>

      <para>"General Sinclair, I'm afraid General Williams and I agree that
      what you did was not exactly entertainment," she paused for a couple
      second before adding, "Sir."</para>

      <para>"You girls are no fun," both Sinclair and Lopez said in

      working on the problem." That's why Sinclair enjoyed talking to the
      Zentraedi leader so much: He was direct and to the point. Kick ass first
      and ask questions later.</para>

      <para>"We'll keep our eyes open, sir." Sinclair promised</para>

      <para>"We will do the same General. Breetai out." The Zentraedi
      commander said as his face disappeared from the screen</para>

      <para>Sinclair turned around to the assembled officers. Most of his
      senior staff was there, as well as members of the task force's
      intelligence community. "Opinions?"</para>

      <para>"Sir," A young Lt. Stood up from the far end of the table as he
      began addressing the task force leadership, "As much as we may hate the
      idea, there is a real possibility that forces under commander Breetai
      conducted the raids." He went on to explain the reasoning behind his
      assertion.</para>

      <para>Sinclair listened carefully. He was not convinced, but he had to
      act upon the suspicions. "I want all efforts directed to identify the
      Zentraedi forces. Until we do we'll proceed on the assumption that they
      are hostile forces..."</para>

      <para>An aide come in to the office and whispered something to the Lt.
      who had just pointed out the possibility of them being friendly forces,
      then he gave the Lt. a ream of papers. After the aide left, the Lt. read
      the material for several minutes, stood again and said, "I don't think
      that will be necessary sir, from wreckage salvaged at the Gettysburg
      ambush and the attack on the Kittyhawk, we pieced together enough
      information to venture a very educated guess."</para>

      <para>Looks were exchanged and smiles slowly crept among the assembled
      officers' faces. "We got 'em" was the single thought around the
      room.</para>

      <para>"Go ahead Lt. I don't like murder mysteries." Sinclair said
      coarsely. His patience was running thin.</para>

      <para>"According to Minister Exedore, this insignias belong to the
      Alphine division, once of the oldest fleets in the Zentraedi army." The
      Lt. paused consulting the notes, "According to the Minister this fleet
      is commanded by a woman; her name is Zeritai and she is as cunning as
      commander Breetai, if not more." The Lt. sat down.</para>

      <para>Sinclair thought about it for several minutes. Sinclair looked at
      the people assembled in the room. First he turned to General Connors,
      his XO; "Steve, I want all the task force's assets at Defcon 2."</para>

      <para>General Connors stood up as he nodded, "Aye, sir," and left the
      room to carry out the order.</para>

      <para>Sinclair turned next to the intelligence staff, "If this Alphine
      fleet appears anywhere I want to know about it. If they fart, I want you
      to tell me what they had for dinner. Your priority is to find them
      understood?"</para>

      <para>Mental groans accompanied the order, but the intelligence group
      nodded their understanding.</para>

      <para>"Dismissed." Sinclair closed the meeting.</para>

      <para>As Sinclair and Williams walked to the beach to enjoy some of
      their almost-non-existent R&amp;R time together, the games had already
      started. Several couples, and in one case two full six-member teams, had
      already erected the nets and drawn the court on the sand.</para>

      <para>Sinclair was not surprised to see Colonel Lopez standing there
      ready to play. The surprise came when he saw who was Lopez' partner.
      Captain Christian Garnham. 'Damn,' thought Sinclair, 'I haven't seen him
      in years'.</para>

      <para>In the years prior to Sinclair's transfer to the ASC, a small
      group of friends was formed on VF-243. Sinclair, Lopez and other members
      of the squadron started living together, along with their wives, while
      on leave, traveling together almost everywhere. Soon the group of
      friends became a real family; for most of them a surrogate of the family
      they had lost during the global war or the initial stages of the
      Robotech War.</para>

      <para>Sinclair and the rest of their extended "family" attended Lopez'
      wife funeral, held a couple weeks after the Zentraedi defeat. They had
      joked on patrol that about whom among them would reach flag rank, about
      who would have the first son or daughter and about how long they would
      each live.</para>

      <para>Sinclair's transfer to the Southern Cross changed things. He moved
      to Monument City along with his fiance Patricia Williams and kept
      sporadic contact with his friends. Work was permeating Sinclair's life
      and, to his own surprise, he proved he was good at it.</para>

      <para>The game in progress brought Sinclair's attention to the present.
      Lopez set for his partner who spiked the ball into the other team's dead
      zone. The crowd went wild and started cheering the winning team.
      Sinclair smiled</para>

      <para>The game was as fierce as Sinclair had ever seen. Points and
      side-outs alternated with one side occasionally scoring two points in a
      row, but as in an accident, Garnham and Lopez won the game and the
      match.</para>

      <para>"Come on, let's go," Sinclair motioned Patricia to follow him as
      he ran to the field before their friends left.</para>

      <para>The winning team was basking on the glow of admiration from the
      cheering fans when they saw Sinclair and Williams and started walking
      towards them. Both officers saluted and, as Sinclair returned the
      salute, commented; "This is definitely an awesome place you got here
      Alex."</para>

      <para>Alex nodded absent mindedly, then looked at Garnham. "Thought that
      the Zentraedi had helped you buy the farm Johnny. How the hell have you
      been?"</para>

      <para>"Nahhh, they didn't like me that much." The alluded shrugged, "By
      the time you transferred to the TASC, I was already selected for
      squadron XO so I moved out of the Knights a couple days after you left."
      They looked at each other for several seconds until Lopez said, "Let's
      go for a drink... my treat."</para>

      <para>Both Sinclair and Garnham smiled, Sinclair said, "I'll take you up
      on that one, heaven knows it doesn't happen very often."</para>

      <para>Admiral Hunter nodded at his end of the videophone connection. "I
      will be visiting Aquaria in the next 3 weeks general. There is something
      that I would like to discuss with you."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, "Aye, sir. Has there been any new information
      regarding the Zentraedi attacks?"</para>

      <para>A grim shake of Hunter's head was all the answer Sinclair needed.
      Things were not looking good on that department. "Thank you admiral, we
      will keep our eyes open." Sinclair promised.</para>

      <para>"I'm counting on that General Sinclair. Hunter out."</para>

      <para>Sinclair sighed as the communication ended. He was growing
      increasingly frustrated with the Zentraedi attacks... he had to do
      something about them, and he had to do it soon.</para>

      <para>Sinclair sat in his office waiting for Admiral Hunter to arrive.
      He had requested specifically no formal reception or escort for this
      meeting. As a matter of fact, he had requested this meeting be kept as
      secret as possible.</para>

      <para>"Come in," Sinclair barked as the door chime sounded.</para>

      <para>Admiral Hunter entered the room flanked by 4 other officers.
      Sinclair stood and saluted his commanding officer. When he returned the
      salute and motioned for everyone to sit, he spoke for the first time. "I
      think that you know how much this whole Zentraedi mess has the council
      ready to suspend the reconstruction effort."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded. He had received reports from Tirol that were
      calling for the Zentraedi leaders' heads for betraying the REF. Cooler
      heads had prevailed and Commander Breetai has offered the services of
      the Zentraedi forces under his command to mine the monopole ore required
      to get the fleet back on their feet</para>

      <para>"And I don't need to tell you that with the Zentraedi forces
      exiled to Phantoma we'll be even more vulnerable to an Invid attack."
      Hunter concluded.</para>

      <para>"What's the game plan, skipper?" Sinclair asked</para>

      <para>"We are in the process of creating 2 special teams that will be
      based here in Aquaria... they will combine elements from all our forces
      on a self contained unit." Hunter looked at the for officers who had
      come in with him before continuing, "General Sinclair, I would like to
      introduce you to Brigadier General Pierre Alexander and his XO, Lt.
      Colonel Reba West, and Commodore Robert O'Connor, and his second in
      command, Laura Powell."</para>

      <para>Handshakes and pleasantries were exchanged before the admiral
      finished his speech, "We're doing this as a black project, general.
      These new troops will be nominally under your command but they will
      report to both of us."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded slowly. He knew what was coming next. "What will
      be the mission, sir?"</para>

      <para>"Hunt and destroy the Alphine forces once and for all," General
      Alexander replied, surprising Sinclair by speaking out of turn. "We'll
      find them, we'll disable them and we will destroy their war making
      capacity, sir."</para>

      <para>Hunter nodded in agreement. "In addition we'll use these Combined
      Arms Teams to defend key locations as needed." Hunter looked at the
      people in the room and asked, "Any questions?"</para>

      <para>"No, sir...." Sinclair replied.</para>

      <para>"Then I will take my leave... you have your orders and they are
      not easy," Hunter said as he stood, "But I know you will carry them out
      the best you can" and left.</para>

      <para>The house was quiet and the lights were out. Sinclair's eyes
      blinked several times as they fought to get used to the dark. He started
      tip-toeing towards the bedroom, adopting the guard position that he had
      learnt in Martial arts all those years ago.</para>

      <para>The sobbing sounds were barely audible coming from the master
      suite. Sinclair hurried up his pace and walked into the room. What he
      found left him speechless.</para>

      <para>Patricia was hiding between the bed and the window, sobbing like a
      little girl, her eyes red from crying and her hair messed up. She looked
      up when he heard foot steps, slowly stood up and began walking towards
      his fiance.</para>

      <para>"What's wrong?" Sinclair asked after a long and uncomfortable
      silence</para>

      <para>"Alex..." Patricia began, stopped and then started again. "Alex...
      I had a medical checkup last week... the doctors found..." Patricia made
      another pause, "abnormal cells on me.... They did a biopsy a couple days
      ago and I just got the results today.... It came back positive"</para>

      <para>For all his years of command; for all the years he had lived with
      death as a possibility, Sinclair stood there... not knowing what to say.
      Sinclair started walking toward Williams very slowly, as if afraid
      something terrible would happen if he moved any faster.</para>

      <para>When he was close enough he said, "Whatever comes babe... no
      matter what it is, we'll face it together."</para>

      <para>Patricia's face moved until her eyes were looking at his,
      "Patricia...." Sinclair started to talk but she put a finger to his lips
      and asked, "don't say anything... just hold me. If I'm going to die,
      then I want to take with me as much time with you as I can."</para>

      <para>Sinclair hugged his fiance carefully, and their hug was the
      beginning of a wonderful night.</para>

      <para>Sinclair respectfully took his shoes off before entering the dojo,
      the same way he had done for the past 35 years. He bowed to the altar
      and then walked to get changed... his hakama, geogi and naginata were in
      the same place he had left them the week before... he prepared himself,
      remembering how he had not wanted to come and how Patricia had insisted
      that she was ill, not dead yet.</para>

      <para>Sinclair emerged from the dressing room and saw several members of
      the dojo already stretching and warming up. He walked toward a small
      group of 2 women and 3 men, bowed and then asked, "Anyone up for a warm
      up?"</para>

      <para>Surprisingly, one of the women nodded and answered, "Sounds
      fine."</para>

      <para>Sinclair's mind was distracted, he couldn't stop thinking about
      Patricia and how long they might or might not have together. He was hit
      several times as he fought to concentrate and not make an ass of
      himself. If Miyako Tanaka sensei saw Sinclair's poor performance she
      said nothing.</para>

      <para>When the time for sparring came, Sinclair was paired up with the
      girl who had warmed up with him. They took position, bowed to each other
      and began circling around... not taking their eyes of each other.
      Suddenly...</para>

      <para>"Do!" The girls screamed as she hit Sinclair's chest side
      armor.</para>

      <para>'Damn,' thought Sinclair. 'This girl is definitely gonna kick my
      ass if I don't concentrate.' He bowed to her again and took the guard
      position.... They started circling each other again.</para>

      <para>Both partners launched simultaneous attacks. Her strike went high
      but his struck her leg.</para>

      <para>'Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?' Sinclair asked himself with a
      satisfied look on his face... then returned to the guard position, and
      got ready for another round.... suddenly Tanaka Sensei declared the
      practice had ended, Sinclair looked around and realized that it was
      getting dark.</para>

      <para>Sinclair started packing his bogu into his bag when suddenly
      Tanaka sensei came to him, "Sinclair-san?" The alluded student quickly
      raised from his kneeling position before answering, "Hai...."</para>

      <para>"Would you do my niece and I the honor of having dinner with us"
      Sensei said motioning Sinclair's sparring partner forward.</para>

      <para>"It would be an honor, but I need to call Patricia first, just to
      make sure she is OK." Sinclair replied. He had been practicing with
      Tanaka sensei for long enough to know that there was something his
      teacher was not telling him. Sinclair talked to his fiance for about 20
      minutes before returning to his sensei and her niece and following them
      to their home.</para>

      <para>Tanaka Sensei's house was located in Gloval City's beachfront,
      surrounded by more modern houses. The house reminded Sinclair of feudal
      Japan buildings... completley made out of wood and paper rice. It was
      like stepping back on time.... Sinclair followed his hosts as they took
      off their shoes before entering the house. The house always reminded
      Sinclair of 17th century Japan's Shogun palace. Somehow they had worked
      the construction of their place so it would appear much bigger than it
      really was. "Please make yourself at home, Sinclair-san," Mariko Tanaka
      offered their guest. Everything was done in a few minutes and Sinclair
      found himself in front of a large amount of Sushi rolls and other
      Japanese foods. As they sat down, Tanaka Miyako sensei looked at
      Sinclair for several seconds before asking, "How is Patricia doing,
      Alexander?" and returning her gaze to the food.</para>

      <para>Sinclair was going to reply but caught himself. He didn't want
      people to think that Patricia was an invalid or anything, but he had to
      be honest. "She is ill, sensei. The doctors don't think she'll make it
      past the end of the year." Sinclair choked, he wanted to be strong, but
      found it extremely hard.</para>

      <para>Both women looked at each other and then at Sinclair. "I am sorry
      to hear that, Alexander.... Patricia seemed like your perfect match.
      What are you planning to do now?" Miyako asked gently.</para>

      <para>Sinclair looked at her for several seconds without saying
      anything, then slowly answered, "I've delegated command of the Task
      Force to my executive officer. I want to be with Patricia while we can
      still be together.... She's the only person I've ever wanted to be
      with."</para>

      <para>Mariko asked, "And then?"</para>

      <para>The new question caught Sinclair by surprise. He had been so
      intent in keeping Patricia in the present that he had not paid any
      attention to the future. "I hadn't thought about that... I was too
      concerned with the present to think about the future."</para>

      <para>"The future is not written in stone, Alexander-san," Tanaka sensei
      answered using Sinclair's first name. "We don't know whether what we
      fear is a reality or only what we don't want to happen."</para>

      <para>"There are so many things that i'm not sure about..." Sinclair's
      voice lowered to barely above a whisper. "Seeing Patricia like this...
      it has made me question some of the choices I've made in my life... like
      joining the RDF, or moving to the Southern Cross when I could have
      retired or stayed where I was... Why did we have to join the Pioneer
      mission?" Sinclair choked, not being able to hold back tears
      anymore.</para>

      <para>Mariko answered, "Because you knew you could make a difference
      Sinclair-san." She paused for a second, "because you would never be able
      to live with yourself if you hadn't helped others."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, still not completely convinced, "But what good am
      I as a leader... as a man, if I can't help those closes to me. How can I
      be expected to lead the thousands who have trusted me with their lives.
      That has always been a sacred duty and now, for the first time, I don't
      know if I can fulfill it sensei."</para>

      <para>Once, General, I faced a similar choice, a time in my life I shall
      never forget. I was torn between a daughter's duty to his father and my
      duty to protect my country. Which was the greater obligation? It was
      only in remembering the teachings of my sensei that the way became
      clear. Duty is a curious river, Tokunaga-sensei used to say, it flows
      uphill as well as down."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded slowly. He knew that his sensei had been estranged
      from her family for at least 20 years. He also knew what sensei meant
      with that observation... he would have to decide sooner rather than
      later what he would do. There were several thousand lives depending on
      it.</para>

      <para>"I will think about it sensei." Sinclair replied aloud, "I think
      it's time to think about quitting while still ahead." He added for
      himself.</para>

        <para>"It occurs to me to wonder what it must have felt like to live
        in a 'Dark Age'. Certainly, one wouldn't likely be conscious of the
        darkness. All one would know is that great struggles have recently
        brought to an end even greater civilizations - and that the time is
        not for reflection on the past or hope for the future, but on the
        rebuilding of the present. Only in retrospect would the darkness

        <para>"For the Galaxy, it seems, a dark age began in 2009, with the

      <para>"We have determined that the SEG prototype is safe to install
      aboard a testbed starship sir." Dr. Jake Simmons concluded his initial
      brief for Sinclair, Dr. Paul Nichols and the other scientists who worked
      on the project.</para>

      <para>"How have you tested it, Dr. Simmons?" One of the scientists,
      colonel Christopher Rodriguez asked. He had been developing nuclear
      warships' power plants before the war and protoculture related equipment
      ever since.</para>

      <para>"We have strapped the SEG to an asteroid, we have then engaged and
      disengaged the SEG's ignition sequence several times without ill
      effects." Dr. Simmons answered. "Furthermore, the SEG ignition mechanism
      requires 3 of the senior officers, one of them being the C.O or the XO,
      to agree that the mechanism is to be engaged, otherwise it will remain
      inert."</para>

      <para>The scientist nodded, not very convinced. "This is too dangerous
      to try on a ship of the line... If I may say so, sir, it has too many
      unknowns attached to it."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded slowly. "We have discussed the problem ad nauseum
      colonel. We have no way of proving that this gizmo will work until we
      have successfully completed the trials." He then turned to Dr. Nichols
      and asked. "What ship will you be using for testing the
      prototype?"</para>

      <para>"We had thought about using the Kittyhawk, sir." Dr. Nichols
      answered, "We can have the hooks for the SEG, installed within 4 months
      and have the prototype ready for trials 3 months after that. We should
      be ready to start live trials early next year."</para>

      <para>Sinclair looked at Rodriguez. "Does that seem OK to you
      colonel?"</para>

      <para>Rodriguez nodded once again, "I don't seem to have a choice but to
      agree with it, do I sir?" Rodriguez shook his head in defeat. "I only
      hope that this 'experiment' of yours doesn't blow on our faces."</para>

      <para>Sinclair agreed, "And that's why we have taken so long in testing
      the prototype to make sure that it won't kill us. We've invested too

      decision was made.</para>

      <para>"I hope you're right, general, for your sake and your crew's."
      Colonel Rodriguez added to himself, "I dearly wish you're right."</para>

      <para>As Sinclair got home, he saw Patricia cooking, something she had
      not done since way before the Pioneer mission had left for Tirol. She
      was busy putting the table and the dishes. Sinclair decided to wait
      outside for a little bit before making himself heard.</para>

      <para>"You took long enough..." Patricia chided with a smile on her
      face, "Food is almost cold. Come on, sit down while I reheat
      everything." Sinclair did as he was told, surprised at the energy
      Patricia was showing.</para>

      <para>"What's going on Trish?" Sinclair asked, curiosity getting the
      best of him.</para>

      <para>"I may as well start living again, Alex. I can't let this disease
      stop me from spending time with those I love." Patricia answered in a
      quiet tone. "Now I understand why you respect Tanaka sensei so much....
      She is a very wise woman."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, speechless for once. So that's why Tanaka sensei
      had breached the subject a couple days ago. She had probably talked to
      Patricia later that day or while he was in meetings. And apparently
      those talks had a deep effect on Trish.</para>

      <para>The dinner was a quiet one; the food was excellent. After dinner,
      Sinclair offered Patricia a drink and poured a brandy for himself....
      There was a long silence; they looked at each other for what seemed like
      an eternity, but was only a couple minutes.</para>

      <para>Patricia began speaking softly, "Tanaka sensei and I talked the
      day after you had dinner with her. We talked about a great many things,
      but it kept coming back to me being selfish and holding back the people
      I love." A deep frown crossed Sinclair's face while Patricia continued.
      "She suggested that perhaps it would be better to enjoy the time we have
      together while we still have it instead of mopping the floor being
      depressed." Patricia concluded as she walked towards Sinclair and sat on
      his lap.</para>

      <para>Sinclair kissed her lightly, "And what are the plans now, boss?"
      Sinclair asked as he played with Patricia's hair.</para>

      <para>"I don't know," Patricia replied as her hands moved down
      Sinclair's chest, "I had thought that tomorrow might be a "Lazy Sunday?"
      Her eyes had a twinkle to them that Sinclair had not seen in
      ages.</para>

      <para>"Hmmmm, that sounds like a good idea," Alexander purred as he
      kissed his fiance again, Damn it all, Tanaka sensei is right... I may as
      well enjoy it Sinclair thought as they kissed passionately.</para>

      <para>The table was set outside for a barbecue. Sinclair was fussing
      with the fire as people kept coming in. Late the night before, Williams
      and Sinclair had agreed that they would be a couple for however long
      they had together.</para>

      <para>As the people filtered in, Sinclair finished fussing over the fire
      and walked towards Patricia, Diego Lopez, and Colonel Gabriel Diaz,
      second in command to Patricia in the Logistics Command, and another
      member of the VF-243 "family".</para>

      <para>"Everything should be ready in about 15 minutes," Sinclair said
      before turning to Diaz, extending his hand and adding, "It's damn good
      to see you Gabriel."</para>

      <para>"Likewise, Alex.... It's been, what, 10, maybe 15 years?" Gabriel
      asked in his soothing speech. "Since I had not heard from you ever since
      you transferred, I thought something had happened to you. Apparently I
      was wrong."</para>

      <para>Sinclair shrugged, a pang of guilt drawing on his face. "The
      Zentraedi didn't like me that much, and neither did Southern Cross High
      Command, so I decided to come back... and it was just on time."</para>

      <para>"And now we got this place and these toys to play with," Diego
      Lopez jumped in, detecting a mood shift that he didn't like. "Let's go
      play 'ball..."</para>

      <para>Both Diaz and Sinclair nodded as they ran after Lopez to the
      volleyball court.</para>

      <para>The game and the music ran for a long time, before the players
      remembered... THE FOOD! They ran to the table, only to find Patricia and
      Anna Paulova setting up the table. "I hope you don't mind cold food,
      gentlemen." Anna chided them.</para>

      <para>Everyone laughed at the remark as they sat down for dinner.</para>

      <para>Dinner was good and the conversation was even better. Memories
      were exchanged and good times remembered. "Do you remember the admiral's
      daughter Diego?" Sinclair asked, unable to contain himself. "I can't
      believe that you got in so much problems."</para>

      <para>Lopez blushed a deep shade or red. "It's hard to forget what
      almost got you busted to private a couple times," the blushing officer
      replied. "I wonder what is she doing now...."</para>

      <para>"She's stationed in Tirol as a civilian teacher." Sinclair
      answered, "She got married about 3 years ago." He quickly added as he
      saw the twinge of pain in his friend's face, "I thought you knew..."
      Lopez shook his head, "I heard through the grapevine, but never thought
      it was true."</para>

      <para>"Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, bud. I thought you had
      already found out." Sinclair said apologetically.</para>

      <para>"That's OK Alex, really." Lopez replied without much enthusiasm,
      silently reproaching his friend and commanding officer for springing the
      news like that.</para>

      <para>Dinner continued, a little more subdued, and when it was done, the
      conversation went back to the times spent before the Zentraedi main
      fleet decided to have a field day destroying Earth, and the time after
      the 'Rain of Death' where they spent time in Brasilia and in space
      aboard the Akagi.</para>

      <para>"Any special requests?" Patricia asked as she started to play.
      Everyone remained silent for a long minute.... Some of them were
      remembering a similar get-together aboard the SDF-1 shortly before Max
      and Miriya Sterling got married; Others were remembering lost loved
      ones; and others, like Sinclair were wondering what the future would be
      like without Patricia around.</para>

      <para>The song changed, other people joined Patricia singing different
      songs. Patricia started playing softly and then the lyrics came, while
      everybody held their breaths as they listened to Robin Hackett's Saying
      Goodbye....</para>

      <para />

      <literallayout class="normal">
Don't wanna leave you this way 
But you know me 
I'm not good at sayin' what's on my mind

It's not that I was untrue 
You know I've always loved you
But sometimes love is just not enough to get me by 
So I'm saying good-bye

				Before you open your eyes I'm leaving cuz I couldn't

      <para>Patricia's voice slowly began to fade as the song ended. Everybody
      kept quiet, not knowing what to say. Suddenly Patricia turned around and
      said, "Thank you...." before walking back into the house.</para>

      <para />

      <para>Alex woke up with a sudden dread washing over him. The bed was
      empty and Patricia was nowhere to be found. As Sinclair walked to the
      bath room, he heard heaving noises and the toilet flush several
      times.</para>

      <para>"Patricia, are you ok?!?!" Sinclair asked with as even a voice as
      he could muster. The day he'd been dreading for the past couple of
      months was finally here.</para>

      <para>Williams shook her head, another mouthful of vomit that followed
      her movements. Sinclair's face went pale as he went to call the
      ambulance. When Sinclair returned he saw Patricia leaning against the
      bathroom's wall... he gently took her in his arms and took her to the
      living room to wait for the paramedics to arrive.</para>

      <para>After what appeared an eternity, the paramedics arrived and took
      Williams to the hospital, with Alexander Sinclair sitting by her side
      holding her hand and whispering everything is gonna be alright over and
      over again.</para>

      <para>Particia's doctor was waiting for her in the emergency room. As
      Sinclair entered the room, the doctor walked to him and forced him
      aside, he sat down and motioned Sinclair to do the same.</para>

      <para>"General Sinclair, I'm Dr. Danielle Evans. I've been treating
      Patricia ever since her biopsy came up positive." The doctor paused for
      a couple seconds, looking at Sinclair. "She knew something like this was
      going to happen sooner rather than later," The doctor went on, "but the
      refused medication because she didn't want to deal with the side
      effects."</para>

      <para>Sinclair shook his head in disbelief, shook his head and asked the
      question he had been avoiding. "How much longer will she live?</para>

      <para>The doctor looked at Sinclair, and, for a second, saw Alexander
      Sinclair, a vulnerable man, and not the commander of 25% of the REF
      fighting forces and the leader of thousands. The doctor patted
      Sinclair's shoulder and said gently, 2 weeks, 2 months... we really
      don't know. I'd never seen a case of cancer as strong as hers."</para>

      <para>"Can I see her?" Sinclair asked expectantly</para>

      <para>"In a couple hours.... We need to get her set in before she can
      receive visitors, sir." The doctor replied evenly. "My recommendation is
      for you to go home and rest while we do our work."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, his body moving without conscious thought. When
      he left the waiting room, he saw Lopez and several other friends waiting
      for him by the door. He looked at his friends, shook his head and
      continued walking towards the door.</para>

      <para>Lopez ran after his boss and blocked the exit. "Unless you want to
      walk, I think it's better if I drive." Sinclair nodded without stopping
      his walk outside. Lopez walked with him and lead him to his car. They
      got in and drove to Sinclair's home, suddenly an empty place with out
      Patricia.</para>

      <para>Lopez walked into Sinclair's house following his boss and friend.
      He headed for the kitchen and asked Sinclair if he wanted something to
      eat while he opened the refrigerator and took out stuff to make
      sandwiches. Sinclair responded with a quick 'no thanks' while he looked
      out the window in the room he had, until earlier that day, shared with
      Patricia.</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, not really hungry but knowing he had to have
      something to eat sooner or later. He looked around the room over and
      over, wishing that it all was a big mistake and that at any moment
      Patricia would be returning home. He knew that it wouldn't happen even
      as he left the room to join his friend in the kitchen</para>

      <para>"She's as good as she can be all thing considered Alex," Lopez
      added as Sinclair entered the kitchen. "I know Dr. Evans and I know
      she'll do her best to keep her with us."</para>

      <para>An absent nod was all the answer Lopez got as Sinclair finished
      his food and headed towards the bedroom again. "The guest room is ready
      for you if you want to stay... and thanks." Sinclair added before
      closing his bedroom's door.</para>

      <para />

      <para>"Can I see her now?" Sinclair had asked after something
      approaching a normal night's sleep and with as even a voice as he
      could.</para>

      <para>The doctor nodded, "She's been asking about you and when you would
      come." A smile, "She's in room 1098."</para>

      <para>Sinclair run to Patricia's room. He had to stop himself and
      remember to knock before entering. A quick knock was all Sinclair did
      before hearing 'come in' from inside.</para>

      <para>Patricia was hooked up to several monitors; an IV tree was
      connected to her left arm and Alex could see fluids and something else
      dripping into Patricia's arms. He looked at her face and saw someone who
      was not the person he spent time with. Her face was pale and her eyes,
      usually bright and full of life, were a shadow of their former
      selves.</para>

      <para>"It's OK Alex, it really doesn't hurt." Patricia said forcing a
      smile to her face. "Doctor Evans told me that she had talked to you last
      night...." Patricia continued, "I didn't tell you before because I
      didn't want it to ruin our time together." Patricia's eyes filled with
      tears as she forced herself to continue. "Alex... I'm sorry...."</para>

      <para>"There's nothing for you to be sorry about." Alex suddenly found
      his voice. "Whatever reasons you had I wouldn't have changed anything of
      what happened before yesterday." Alex looked at Patricia directly in the
      eyes and said, "I love you Trish. I always have and always will."</para>

      <para>"I love you too Alex, I've never loved anyone as I do love you."
      Patricia replied, her eyes moist with tears as they closed. Suddenly a
      loud alarm when off in one of the monitors. A nurse came running into
      the room and pushed Sinclair out of the way while yelling 'Code Blue' to
      the people who were coming in after her. Another nurse took the startled
      officer out of the room and closed the door behind her as she went back
      in.</para>

      <para>Sinclair stood there for several minutes; Expecting someone to
      come out the room and tell him that it all had been a joke and that
      Patricia was fine. A little corner of his mind told Sinclair, She's
      gone... what are you planning to do now?</para>

      <para>Sinclair shook his head several times. Great leader, aren't you?
      When someone you love and you can't do anything to help her. Sinclair
      left the floor and walked downstairs where he could have some coffee and
      a cigarette.</para>

      <para>He sat down in an outside court and looked around, feeling alone
      for the first time in his life and it was an horrible feeling. Slowly,
      Colonel Lopez and other friends of Sinclair's appeared in the lounge and
      sat down next to him without a word being spoken.</para>

      <para>After what seemed like an eternity, Sinclair found himself walking
      to the elevator and going back to the 10th floor. The nurses looked at
      him and then looked away.... Dr. Evans was coming out of Patricia's
      room, a grim look on her face. Before Alexander Sinclair could ask, she
      murmured, "We did all we could, General. She was too far gone."</para>

      <para>Sinclair and the doctor both stopped after the doctor made her
      pronouncement. "Is she..." Sinclair asked in a whisper.</para>

      <para>The doctor nodded.</para>

      <para>Sinclair's eyes filled with tears.... He remained silent for
      several minutes. Then he started to walk toward Patricia's room... her
      body was still there.</para>

      <para>Sinclair sat next to his fiance's body holding her hand. Slowly
      the tears started to silently fall from his face and, this time, he
      didn't stop them. He cried for what seemed to be hours and suddenly the
      fading light of dusk illuminated the room.</para>

      <para>Sinclair walked out of the room and saw all his friends waiting
      for him outside. He didn't say a word and continued walking to the
      exit.</para>

      <para>Dr. Evans stopped Sinclair just as he was getting to the exit. Her
      face was also slick with tears. Without saying a word she hugged
      Sinclair. "I am sorry I couldn't save her, sir. I just wanted to tell
      you that I... we did our best."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded slowly, his mind still numb with recent events. "I
      know doc. Colonel Lopez trusts you, and that is good enough for me." The
      doctor's eyes looked at him before replying, "But apparently it was not
      good enough. Had I been better she would still be with us."</para>

      <para>Sinclair shook his head. "The best way to honor her memory is to
      keep going doctor... don't let her death prevent us from going on with
      our lives." Sinclair was as surprised as the doctor when he heard
      himself say that.</para>

      <para>The doctor wiped the tears away from her face and nodded, a faint
      smile drawing itself on her face. "If you need anything, please let me
      know...." The doctor stopped, as if remembering something, took
      something from her pocket and gave it to Sinclair, "Patricia asked me to
      give you this after she had gone."</para>

      <para>Sinclair took the letter and put it in his pocket. Sinclair said
      "Thank you doctor," as he left the building, only to find all his
      friends standing outside waiting for him.</para>

      <para>No one said anything, but they all walked with Sinclair to the
      cars that were waiting for them. They drove to the commander's house in
      Gloval base and got off along with Lt.Col. Lopez and Colonel Diaz. The
      lights were on and people were waiting for them in the living
      room.</para>

      <para>"I'm sorry about Patricia.... She will be missed." Andrew Walker
      stood as his commander and friend came into the living room. They shook
      hands and hugged each other.</para>

      <para>Sinclair excused himself shortly after arriving back home and went
      to his room, closed the door behind him and began to look around the
      room, all of Patricia's things still there to remind him of his
      loss.</para>

      <para>Suddenly Sinclair remembered the letter the doctor had given him;
      he took it and carefully opened the envelope. The letter was written on
      the 15th, shortly after Patricia was admitted to the hospital.... Her
      hand writing was as regular as Sinclair remembered it being.</para>

      <para />

      <para>It took a while for Sinclair's mind to recognize the lyrics that
      opened the letter as the song Patricia sang the last time they had all
      been together. He kept reading.</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>I know how hard this must be for you, and I'm sorry I kept you
        in the dark as long as I did, but I know you and I also know that I
        didn't want to burden you with my problem. I also wanted to enjoy our
        time together, as much or as little as it was.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>Sinclair kept reading, curious now as to what else Patricia would
      say.</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>I know I was wrong in keeping things to myself and I ask you to
        forgive me now that we won't be together in body, but I will always be
        there in your heart, if you let me.</para>

      <para>Sinclair and several other officer entered one of the hangar bays
      on the Kittyhawk as the assembled crew and officers stood at
      attention</para>

      <para>"At ease," Sinclair ordered as his troops took their positions for
      the funeral service. He looked at the chaplain and nodded for him to
      begin the service.</para>

      <para>As the chaplain began talking, Sinclair phased him out and started
      to look at the people assembled in the hangar. There were several people
      who worked with Patricia in logistics, some of their friends and some
      people who had come because they thought it was the right thing to
      do.</para>

      <para>When the chaplain finished his part of the ceremony he turned to
      Sinclair and nodded. Sinclair stood from where they were siting and did
      a short speech before calling everyone to attention once again.</para>

      <para>The crew of the Kittyhawk had modified one of the missile
      launchers for the occasion. The coffin was loaded on the emplacement

      <para>As people began falling out, Sinclair stopped his chief engineer
      and asked, "When will the SEG be ready for trials?"</para>

      <para>"We're shooting for 7 months. Some of the systems' integration
      work to make the SEG work with the other systems are plain dangerous,
      sir. I do have my reservations about running a system like that on your

      <para>"I want it done as soon as possible," Sinclair replied... "I want
      to know once and for all if this thing is all that I've been
      told."</para>

      <para>The chief engineer nodded. His expression said it all... he
      thought it was madness.</para>

      <para />

      <para>"Yes, Diego. I'm reassigning you to the Kittyhawk for the SEG
      Trials and the next patrol." The order was simple and direct, although
      the officer receiving it was not very happy with it.</para>

      <para>"I suppose I don't have a choice, do I?" Lt. Col Lopez answered
      rethorically. "OK, when do you want us aboard the Kittyhawk?"</para>

      <para>"No hurry, I want you aboard along with the rest of the people who
      are transferring aboard next month." Sinclair thought aloud. "The
      Zentraedi attacks have grown more vicious and I want my best people with
      me if we have to deal with them."</para>

      <para>Lopez nodded, still not very convinced. "May I ask what are you
      planning to do?"</para>

      <para>"First I want to test the S.E.G and then I want to do some serious
      hunting." Sinclair answered in a low tone, almost a growl, "I'm sick and
      tired of how things are going. The Zentraedi do not deserve the beating
      they are taking and I swear I will do my best to help fixing this
      problem."</para>

      <para>His friend nodded as Sinclair looked at him. "We need to find this
      sons of bitches and give them what they deserve." Sinclair concluded as
      his fist hit the table.</para>

      <para>"Aye, sir. That we'll do," was Lopez's answer as he walked out of

      <para>Sinclair sat down at the lounge's piano and softly started to

      filing the room.</para>

      <para>"Start again, from the top, please." A female voice brought
      Sinclair out of his meditation. He looked around to see who had made the
      request and saw a beautiful woman... tall, Sinclair guessed about 5'-9"
      or 5'-10" dark blonde hair and a stunning pair of legs. Sinclair did as
      requested and started playing the first chords of the song.</para>

I look at this mountain
So many heartaches wide 
And I can't help but wonder 
Where's the other side 
I've got to be honest 
I've got my doubts 
These tears are asking me
What's this got to do with love? 
Baby, I'll tell you something 
To help us through this long, dark night

      <para>People had slowly started to fill into the lounge and they

      <para>Sinclair took his eyes of the piano for a second and saw the crowd
      listening to them in silence. His eyes grew wide as he returned to
      playing, and looking at the woman singing with them.</para>

      <para />

      <para>As the band played the last chords of the song the audience stood
      and cheered loudly. The strong reaction made Sinclair blush as he bowed
      to them in return.</para>

      <para>As the band moved to the wings, the owner of the lounge came to
      them smiling broadly. The owner looked at the woman and said, "That was
      beautiful, Megan. I really loved that song." The woman, Meghan, blushed.
      The owner then turned around to face Sinclair. "That was some awesome
      piano, Alex. People loved it." Sinclair nodded absentmindedly, his eyes
      still on his badmate. "It was nothing... we had a good singer this
      time." Meghan nodded at the compliment and replied, "Players didn't do
      too bad at all."</para>

      <para>"May I buy you a drink... Megan?" Sinclair asked with
      uncharacteristic modesty.</para>

      <para>"I don't know.... Mom always warned me about accepting drinks from
      strangers..." Megan answered playfully; she winked at her new friend and
      finished, "Actually, I would be delighted, Alex."</para>

      <para>As they walked to the bar, dark thoughts crossed Sinclair's mind,
      Megan's name sounded familiar but he could not place it. They sat down
      at the bar... things seemed to go to well.... They sat in the bar and
      ordered their drinks. Sinclair ordered a Gin and Ginger Ale, while Megan
      ordered a Margarita.</para>

      <para>The sat down at the bar, slowly sipping their drinks while looking
      at each other. Alex smiled and asked, "What do you do Megan... are you
      in the military?"</para>

      <para>Megan looked down, trying to avoid Sinclair's questions. "I've
      been reassigned as commander of the Kittyhawk's air group sir." Her tone
      changed slightly, becoming more formal. "Captain Megan Cameron REFN,
      sir." She looked at Sinclair again before continuing, "I was commander
      of VAF 309, The Banshees before receiving a promotion and the assignment
      to your ship."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded.... Although the REF had relaxed policies
      regarding relationships between officers, and between officers and
      enlisted personnel, it still made for a rocky road for officers who
      decided to pursue a relationship.</para>

      <para>Sinclair arched an eyebrow, "How did you happen to appear just
      when I was starting to play one of my favorite songs?" He looked at her
      again, curiosity painted in his eyes.</para>

      <para>"Just coincidence, I assure you. I love this place and when I
      heard someone starting playing that song..." Megan stopped for a couple
      seconds before continuing, "I couldn't help but walk to the musicians
      and see who it was and seeing if I could play with them."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, "Well... I would love to do it again. Your voice
      sounded beautiful."</para>

      <para>Megan blushed, "I would like for us to play together again, sir.
      You play very well too."</para>

      <para>As General Sinclair sat in the command chair, he couldn't help but
      remember all the times that Patricia and him had joked about sitting in
      the command chair of the SDF-3. Things were different now and he didn't
      know if he was ready for that.</para>

      <para>"All departments report ready for departure, sir. We are good to
      go." The young ensign running conn informed. "We await your command to
      depart."</para>

      <para>"Well, ensign... take us out of here." Sinclair ordered. "Set a
      course for testing area alpha."</para>

      <para>"Aye, sir." Answered the navigator. "Course laid in..."</para>

      <para>"Get us out of here... engage space fold system when ready."
      Sinclair concluded the ritual.</para>

      <para>The ship arrived on station without incidents, the conformal space
      fold field slowly collapsing as the ship reentered normal space.</para>

      <para>"Conn, have engineering begin pre-trial inspection of the SEG
      device and advice me when they've completed it." Sinclair ordered,
      apprehension growing in him that something was not going to work
      out.</para>

      <para>"Aye, sir... engineering reports that they should have the
      inspection completed in 45 minutes." Conn answered.</para>

      <para>"Very well. I will be in my ready room." Sinclair said as he stood
      from the command chair and walked to his office. Once inside, Sinclair
      closed the door and looked at the pictures sitting on his desk... A very
      young couple wearing military uniforms Sinclair an ensign, and Williams,
      still in the uniform of an academy cadet. Sinclair when he received his
      promotion to colonel, with Patricia pinning his eagle pins. He sighed
      and started reading reports about troop readiness.</para>

      <para>"Sir... Engineering reports test completed and SEG ready for
      testing." The ensign at conn reported. "Colonel Brightling request your
      presence on the bridge ASAP."</para>

      <para>Sinclair stood and answered he was on his way.</para>

      <para>The bridge of the RSS Kittyhawk was a beehive of activity.
      Officers were running to their assigned stations, crews from engineering
      monitored the status of electronic systems where they thought might be
      problems. uyh As Sinclair walked to his command chair, two ensigns gave
      him paperwork to sign, as he did he saw his chief engineer walk into the
      bridge and report that everything was ready.</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, the apprehension that he felt while in his
      quarters started growing again. Something was bothering him, but he
      couldn't pinpoint what it was. He clicked a button on his command chair
      and waited for a few seconds before beginning.</para>

      <para>"Attention all hands, this is General Sinclair. We will be testing
      a new prototype that has been installed in the Kittyhawk." Sinclair
      paused for a second. "We'll be testing a singularity effect
      generator.... an artificial black hole if you want. There's a chance
      that we won't make it... and there's the chance that we'll end up
      stranded somewhere without being able to come back. This mission implies
      a high degree of trust and I am deeply honored that you've chosen to
      trust me with your lives... I will make the best effort to bring you
      back home alive. Sinclair out."</para>

      <para>The bridge crew observed their commander for a few seconds.
      Sinclair turned to them, "Prepare to engage the SEG... start with the 10
      minute countdown." A loud alarm began to sound throughout the ship as
      the science officer announced the engaging of the SEG.</para>

      <para>Sinclair's hands tightened their grip over the arms of the command
      couch and his stomach was turning into a know. The SEG countdown
      continued; 5 minutes; 3 minutes; 1 minute.</para>

      <para>When the 45 seconds alert was announced, another voice broke the
      commander's concentration.</para>

      <para>"Sir, we're receiving a distress call from the RSS Avalon. They
      are making an emergency defold in this sector and would like to know if
      we can render assistance." That caused Sinclair's head to run
      sharply.</para>

      <para>"Advice the Avalon that we're testing a prototype and we can not
      assist, then patch me to engineering." The young airman (the name had
      stuck even though more than half of Sinclair's bridge crew were female)
      patched Sinclair through to Engineering.</para>

      <para>"Yoshio... any way to stop the countdown?" Sinclair asked
      Commander Yoshio Kodama, his Chief Engineer. "We may have an emergency
      on our hands."</para>

      <para>"Sorry sir, but it is not...." A loud alarm sounded on the bridge
      and before Sinclair could ask what the problem was the astrogation
      officer came in the commnet, "General. The Avalon is defolding 500
      kilometers from us sir!" Sinclair tried to raise engineering to abort
      the SEG sequence when all of a sudden, the world turned pitch black
      before the crew lost consciousness.</para>

      <para />

      <para>Sinclair woke up with a sudden memory on his head. The Avalon....
      A space fold operation near the SEG test.... Ship had gone
      dark....</para>

      <para>Am I dead? a little voice asked Sinclair. Then his brain
      registered other voices, mostly moaning, around the bridge.... It was
      several minutes before he could ask for a status report.</para>

      <para>"Sir... this does not make sense... but...." The astrogation
      officer's shook his head, "But there's not other explanation..."</para>

      <para>"Spit it out, Lt.... I hate mysteries... where are we?" Sinclair
      was starting to worry. His astrogation officer was a rock... sometimes
      driving his Commanding Officer nuts with his calm demeanor. It had to be
      something really big for him to get as concerned as this."</para>

      <para>The Lt. nodded and began his report. "Sir... according to the
      position of the stars and their period of rotation, corroborated by our
      analysis of the star we are orbiting, is our conclusion that we are in
      the Sol system. The approximate date is December, 2009."</para>

      <para>Sinclair's breath stopped. For several seconds he looked out of
      the bridge viewport down to what he had assumed to be an artificial
      Space Station of some kind. "Now you will tell me this is a joke, right
      Lt?" Sinclair managed not to scream the question.</para>

      <para>The Lt. cringed at the question, but managed to keep a straight
      face, "I wish it was sir. We've checked our results at least 5 times."
      He didn't add that there have been at least 5 people who had rechecked
      his initial calculations and that Engineering had also checked the
      results.</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded.... There was no use in tearing the Lt. a new
      asshole and now it was time for him to start thinking as a commander. He
      turned to the Lt. and asked, "Please let CHENG know that I would like to
      talk to him as soon as possible."</para>

      <para>Then he turned to his Science Officer and asked, "What's our
      status?"</para>

      <para>The science officer shook his head grimly. "The lower 3 decks on
      each nacelle have been severely damaged and had to be evacuated.... Our
      Oxygen supply will last 72 hours sir... then we'll all die due to oxygen
      deprivation." The science officer, LtCol Jean Paul Williams, was
      strangely calm when he presented their death warrants.</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, the anger gone from his voice. "Options?" He
      looked at the assembled officers and waited for someone to speak. "Sir,
      the only thing we know for sure is that we can't change history... we
      have no way of knowing what will happen if we interact or do something
      in this time period." LtCol Williams spoke again. "There are many things
      that we don't know and shouldn't risk changing."</para>

      <para>"And what happens if Breetai's fleet encounters the Kittyhawk and,
      maybe, the Avalon and who knows what else?" Countered Colonel Lopez,
      "They will consider us a much larger threat than what we were at this
      time and we may not even have to worry about the Masters."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, his head was swimming with the potential
      problems, and the potential solutions. Megan Cameron suddenly said, "And
      what would happen if we lend history a hand?"</para>

      <para>Everybody looked at Megan as if she'd said, 'the crayon is
      purple.' Sinclair looked at her, "And what's that supposed to
      mean?"</para>

      <para>"There are a few things that we know for certain, sir." Captain
      Cameron began, "we know for a fact that the moonbase forces did not
      respond to the initial Zentraedi invasion." She let that hang in the air
      for a few seconds, "And we also know that Dr. Lang was not on the island
      when the Zentraedi attacked."</para>

      <para>Sinclair looked around and saw that everyone was as surprised as
      he was. "How can we be sure of this, captain? What makes you so positive
      that these things did happen." Sinclair looked at the commander of the
      Kittyhaw's airwing waiting for her answer.</para>

      <para>"The ship's library should have the reports, sir." Captain Cameron
      replied. "My father was stationed at moon base Copernicus and he used to
      tell me that something had happened to the protoculture generators and
      to the airlocks that allowed fighters to deploy."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded again, his mind trying hard to piece all the
      information that he was receiving from his staff. "Do we have anything
      we can fool their IFF codes with, something like an old shuttle?"</para>

      <para>Commander Kodama nodded, "We have an old shuttle that we were
      about to use as a practice drone. It should be flyable and space worthy,
      I can tell you in about 30 minutes."</para>

      <para>Sinclair looked around several times, trying to decide on who to
      send where. "Colonel Lopez... you will take a shadow Legioss and bring
      Dr. Lang aboard... he's the only one who can hook old generators to our
      power supply."</para>

      <para>Lopez's eyes blinked several times. "You want me to do
      what?"</para>

      <para>"I want you to go down to the island and fetch Lang.... You were
      in Macross for 2 years before the initial attack. You should know your
      way around." Sinclair replied bluntly.</para>

      <para>Lopez nodded, still not believing what he was being ordered to do.
      Sinclair then turned to the rest of his officers. "Colonel Williams,
      Captain Cameron... please put together a 6-person team to go to
      Copernicus in the shuttle. I will lead that group myself." Sinclair
      paused briefly, "Remember that we need people who can keep their heads
      cool under stress and who have been here before..." Sinclair let the
      orders hang in the air for a few seconds, "Any questions?" When he heard
      no replies to his questions, he dismissed the group, "We will meet in
      the hangar alpha in 45 minutes."</para>

      <para>As the meeting broke up, Colonel Lopez stayed behind, "Alex, can I
      have a word with you?"</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded and motioned Lopez to take a seat, "What's on your
      mind Colonel."</para>

      <para>"This mission, sir... it's pure madness and you know it."
      Uncharacteristically, Lopez was agitated and upset. "It will get us all
      killed, or even worse. I can't believe that you would even consider a
      plan like this!"</para>

      <para>"First of all, Colonel, if you have any better ideas then bring
      them on." Sinclair was sorry he had to respond so crossly to his friend
      but, to his surprise, stress was beginning to get at him too. "In case
      you forgot we also have the Avalon to deal with." A pause followed while
      Sinclair collected his thoughts and calmed himself down. "I am
      responsible for the people under my command and I will do what's
      necessary to rescue them with minimal damage to the people we may
      encounter or to history as we know it."</para>

      <para>Lopez nodded again, taken aback by his commander's directness.
      "Yes, sir.</para>

      <para>As Lopez turned around to leave, Sinclair added, "Trust me... we
      will make it back, that's why I need my best people to take care of
      these missions. I wouldn't have anyone else down at Macross City than
      you."</para>

      <para />

      <para>The assembled personnel for the mission stood at attention as
      General Sinclair entered the room. He motioned everyone to sit
      down.</para>

      <para>"I think it's not necessary to tell you how important this mission
      is." Sinclair began the final briefing. "Colonel Lopez will go down to
      Macross Island and bring Doctor Emile Lang to help us hook generators
      that we will bring from moon base Copernicus."</para>

      <para>Jean Paul Williams raised his hand and Sinclair gave him the
      floor. "One thing that we must prevent at all costs is to modify
      history. We must not do anything that will change the way things
      actually happened." Williams paused and then added, "For us to do
      otherwise will mean a lot of problems further down the line."</para>

      <para>Everyone nodded grimly. The stakes of these two missions were very
      high and every one knew it. There was no margin for error and that added
      some more stress for all involved.</para>

      <para>As if to reinforce the idea general Sinclair added, "Today is
      December 2nd... we must be back before the 5th... we still need to find
      and decide what to do with the Avalon... assuming it survived. We need
      to be out of here before the morning of December 07... if at all."
      Sinclair waited a few moments before dismissing the crews and standing
      up to go to his shuttle.</para>

      <para>Captain Cameron sat next to Sinclair in the copilot's seat. She
      looked at her commander and smiled briefly before returning to the task
      of getting the shuttle ready to flight.</para>

      <para>In the next berth, colonel Diego "Lucky" Lopez, was preflighting
      the Legios that he would be taking down to Earth. He looked at his
      fighter and then at his helmet... the same one that he had kept from his
      days as a Lt. on the Knights. He looked at the MFDs (multi function
      displays) and sighed. It had not been long after the initial Zentraedi
      attack that he had met his wife and it hadn't been more than 3 years
      before his wife had died.</para>

      <para>Lopez's mind chided him for dwelling too much on the past, he
      shook his head, climbed to the alpha element of his Legios and
      announced, "Mission 2 ready for departure."</para>

      <para>"Roger, mission 2." The voice of the Kittyhawk's senior air
      controller came over the comm channel. They were good friends and they
      had spent more than one leave together. "Take care of that ass of yours
      and make sure you don't go chasing girls down there."</para>

      <para>"Awww, come on. Where's the fun of that?" Lopez replied as he
      began taxing his fighter for launch. The Black legios fighter with its
      two components, the alpha and the beta. The alpha was the real aerospace
      fighter, the beta was nothing more than huge trusters attached to a
      cockpit and weapons.</para>

      <para>General Sinclair and captain Cameron looked at the fighter as it
      launched from the bay. "I hope he makes it." Sinclair murmured to
      himself. "I know he will do it, sir. Have faith in the colonel." Captain
      Cameron said from her piloting station. "Knowing him he will bring
      presents for everybody when he comes back."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, his mind as far away from the shuttle as Tirol
      was from Earth. He kept watching the Legios until it disappeared from
      the hangar's view... Sinclair had the sinking sensation that he was
      sending his friend to die. And he didn't like the feeling at all.</para>

      <para>"Mission 1, ready for launch." Megan Cameron's voice brought
      Sinclair out of his meditation as his hands automatically continued the
      preparations for take off, and as he took the stick to guide the
      shuttle, people in the cockpit of the shuttle heard Sinclair say,
      "Please Lord... don't let me fuck up," as he accelerated the shuttle to
      take-off speed.</para>

      <para>Colonel Lopez had changed himself into civilian clothes before
      leaving his fighter hidden near the road he was walking into the city.
      The way he was walking towards the city didn't let him see the car
      coming from behind until it was almost on top of him.</para>

      <para>The brakes on the car screeched as the driver fought to keep
      control before running over the stranger. As the car came to a stop, the
      driver got out of the car and moved to help the person she'd almost run
      over.</para>

      <para>"I'm sorry... you came out of nowhere... and I barely had time
      to..." The driver, a stunning female, tried to apologize. Lopez
      dismissed her apologies with a wave of his hand, "I should have looked
      both ways before starting to walk with my back against incoming
      traffic."</para>

      <para>The woman nodded without being very convinced, "My name is
      Heather..." she said as she extended her hand, both to help her new
      friend up and as a way of greeting him. Diego Lopez stood and looked at
      his ride for several seconds before saying, "My name is Diego... thanks
      for the save," and smiling warmly.</para>

      <para>"Not a problem handsome," Heather replied with a wink. "It's not
      everyday that I get to pickup a handsome man in the middle of nowhere."
      They looked at each other for a couple more minutes; then she added, If
      you're going to the city I can give you a ride.</para>

      <para>As the shuttle closed on the landing field general Sinclair, now a

      longer.</para>

      <para>"This is Copernicus Approach to Shuttle A65489, please transmit
      landing clearance and standby." The controller was crisp and tense, as
      if they wer expecting something to happen thought Sinclair as he
      replied. "This is shuttle A65489, transmitting clearance and standing
      by."</para>

      <para>"This is where it gets interesting," someone in the passenger
      section exclaimed. "Damn right it does," another voice answered. "We get
      to see how the old timer lived before big mistake #1."</para>

      <para>Sinclair grimaced, I didn't think I'd qualify as an old timer that
      soon. As people moved around the passenger area, Sinclair risked a look
      back and said, "Get ready people... we need to get those generators and
      we need to make it quick."</para>

      <para>As the shuttle landed, everyone made sure that their uniforms were
      tidy and wouldn't call attention to themselves. Sinclair was the first
      one out, a nervous breath coming out of his mouth. He looked around and
      motioned for his group to come out of the shuttle.</para>

      <para>The plan that Jean Paul Williams and Megan Cameron had worked out
      was very simple yet required perfect timing and a lot of luck. As the
      group moved around the base, they were surrounded by people who had no
      idea of what would happen in the next couple days.... Sinclair walked to
      the engineering spaces, followed by the 6 other members of his group.
      The place was huge.... None of them could understand that the enormous
      machinery in this cavern would do the same thing than the generators
      aboard the Kittyhawk....</para>

      <para>As Sinclair walked to the duty officer's desk there was a note of
      tension in his voice. They had assumed the identity of a group of
      officers and engineering trainees from the Academy who had an accident
      while taking off from Macross and who, fortunately or unfortunately
      enough, had not reported to the control tower or the medical
      facility.</para>

      <para>They looked around as they were escorted on a tour of the
      facility, they were also working on ways of disabling the security
      system and taking the section until they could get the generator into a
      shuttle and back to the Kittyhawk.</para>

      <para>Jean Paul Williams looked at Sinclair and nodded. The group left
      the engineering section and went to their assigned quarters. as the
      group settled on their quarters, the science officer began to work on
      their plan.</para>

      <para>As the morning came, Jean Paul Williams and Sinclair conducted
      another tour of the installation. While they walked, Williams asked his
      commanding officer if he was ready. Sinclair looked at his science
      officer with a surprise looked. "What the hell are you talking
      about?"</para>

      <para>"You seem distracted," Williams observed, "I just want to make
      sure that everything is okay. We can't afford anything short of
      perfection." Williams looked at his boss again, shook his head and
      continued walking. Sinclair tried to say something but couldn't think
      what, as his science officer walked away from him.</para>

      <para>The teams spread out on the city and began to plant their
      leads.</para>

      <para />

      <para>As his mysterious driver brought him to the city, Lopez asked, "Do
      you have a place for me to stay? I am not supposed to report to base
      until tomorrow afternoon and I'm not feeling like 'let's get busy
      detail.'"</para>

      <para>Heather looked at him for several seconds before replying, "I have
      a feeling that I'm going to regret this...." She paused again and then
      added, "Hop in handsome... you're on."</para>

      <para>The drive to her place was strangely quiet... neither of them
      wanted to break the silence and they seemed to have a lot on their
      minds. The drive ended 20 minutes later when Heather pulled into the
      driveway of her home.</para>

      <para>Lopez quickly looked at the house and blinked. It was a rather
      spacious house, with several rooms visible from the driveway. The place
      looked familiar for some reason, but Lopez couldn't place it. They got
      off the car and Heather looked at him, a mischievous smile on her face
      as she bowed to him to go into her home first.</para>

      <para>The house was sparsely decorated. There were paintings of a couple
      riding horses through what looked like a cliff. There was another
      picture of her host wearing jumpsuit, like the ones used to parachute
      jump. Lopez looked around some more and saw a piano with some scores
      sitting on top. He walked to the piano and began to read the
      scores.</para>

      <para>"Find anything you like?" Heather asked coming back from the
      kitchen carrying two glasses and a botlle of whisky with her. The REF
      officer turned around and saw is new found friend wearing a t-shirt
      leaving very little to the imagination as she walked towards him and
      invited Diego to have a drink with her.</para>

      <para>As they sat down in the couch, Heather had a twinkle in her yes
      that Lopez had not seen before. She smiled as she sipped from her glass.
      Diego Lopez, a half colonel in the Robotech Expeditionary Force was
      speechless as she moved closer to him. The kiss would be one that he
      would remember for years... passionate and tender.</para>

      <para>As Lopez found his breath and his mind, the couple moved to the
      bedroom...</para>

      <para />

      <para>The orders had been falsified and the group moved to their
      objective, the protoculture generators. Sinclair led the way as the
      group planned an additional distraction for their "hosts" to worry
      about.</para>

      <para>The group walked into engineering and started moving one of the
      generators and began unplugging it from its couplings when an
      engineering officer started moving towards them and screaming at the top
      of their lungs for the people to stop. "I don't know what the hell you
      think you're doing but I want you to put the generator back the way it
      was, and I want you to do it right now..."</para>

      <para>"Did you get the memorandum from RDF high command?" Sinclair asked
      feigning surprise. "We were asked to move one of these generators to
      Macross to provide power for a new group of veritech fighters being set
      up for defense."</para>

      <para>The officer shook his head, a little less sure than he was just a
      minute before, his face regstered surprise and confusion, his resolve
      becoming a little less firm as time passed. Sinclair decided to press
      his advantage.... "Apparently you were not paying attention when the
      briefer stopped by 4 days ago... is that right?"</para>

      <para>The officer quickly shook his head. "No, sir. I just wasn't told
      about the transfer, that's all." He paused for a second and then added,
      "I will check it on the master computer, if that's ok with you."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded slowly, things were getting a little tight as far
      as time was concerned. The review took precious time and time was
      something they didn't have too much of but the man was impressed by his
      newfound importance.</para>

      <para />

      <para>As he looked around the base, Lopez weighed his options as time
      was running out. He had to get to Lang and somehow talk him into going
      with him to the stranded REF warship and help them hook the generators.
      Lopez's thoughts made him oblivious to his surroundings and the two
      officers coming his way.</para>

      <para>The two female officers stood in front of the ensign for a while
      and then the first officer commented that new recruits were forgetting
      their manners. The second one replied that they should do something to
      correct the situation. Lopez turned around as quickly as he could and
      saw a fair skinned woman with the rank of commander and a darker skinned
      woman with the rank of Lieutenant looking at him with mischief on their
      eyes... Lisa Hayes and Claudia Grant looked a lot less impossing than
      their official portraits made them look but they were still stunning
      beauties.</para>

      <para>Lopez stood up and saluted smartly, trying very hard not to make
      any comments about how good the female officers looked, and not telling
      them what their futures were and how would they be affected by
      it.</para>

      <para>The two officers left, talking aloud about the lack of discipline
      among junior officers and laughing about the incident.</para>

      <para>Lopez looked at the two officers and was remineded of his mission.
      He stood up and walked towards the Robotechnology labs on base. The
      doors are more heavily armored than I thought they'd be, thought Lopez
      as he walked around the perimeter of the base...</para>

      <para>He saw his friend Heater leaving the base and that decided him in
      an course of action.</para>

      <para />

      <para>Sinclair and his troops moved into the generator space as silently
      and as quickly as they could... time was running out for their friends
      and the other ship's crew.</para>

      <para>People moved around seting charges and getting everything ready
      for their 'attack' the following day. The stress level was high and, in
      several instances, Sinclair heard the quiet mutter of one of his people
      and cringed.</para>

      <para>People moved as carefully as they could, making certain that
      things would happen the way they had planned and not otherwise. When
      they were done, they returned to Megan cameron's quarters and began
      discussing the details of the plan one last time before putting into
      action.</para>

      <para>The REF group moved around the base with efficiency born out of
      desperation. Their first order of business was to disengage the
      generator and put it into their shuttle. This caused a lot of questions
      and concerns but the fake orders they had put into the bases computer
      had seen to the questions being answered.</para>

      <para>As they were getting the shuttle prepped for launch, the scientist
      who had confronted them earlier came towards them backed up by a
      security squadron. Sinclair looked at his people and worked a little
      faster.</para>

      <para>The Engineer shouted something as the security crew began running
      towards the shuttle. Sinclair motioned for Megan and one of the other
      members of the team to take positions, along with him, on the shuttle
      hatch. The guards took positions behind crates and construction
      equipment and opened fire on the people stealing the protoculture
      generator.</para>

      <para>The REF team was reluctant to open fire but was forced to do so
      when the securtity team got too close to the shuttle for comfort. They
      used their weapons on stun, something that would not be invented for
      another 5 years.</para>

      <para>The security guards fell one after another as the REF team boarded
      the shuttle and took off. The alarms were bringing more and more people
      to the shuttle hangar and people were getting ready to intercept them on
      their veritech fighters. Before giving the order for takeoff, Megan
      typed a series of commands and smiled as if her big plan had been
      carried out.</para>

      <para>As the shuttle got farther away from the base, the crew switched
      the transponder to the Kittyhawk's frequency and requested permission
      for landing and a status of the ship.</para>

      <para>When the crew landed a team of egineers were waiting to move the
      generator to the engineering deck and medical officers came to
      decontaminate the crew and treat any potential injury. What bothered
      Sinclair was that the report was not good. "We've concetrated all the
      crew on the uper 10 decks of the main section, sir... We estimate our
      oxygen supply to last 48 hours at the most."</para>

      <para>Sinclair arrived on the bridge to a heated discussion between an
      engineering officer and Jean Paul Williams, the chief science officer
      about the length of the remaining oxygen supply. "Gentlemen, instead of
      bitching like women, I want you to work on ways to extend our oxygen
      supply and give Col. Lopez the time he needs to complete his
      task."</para>

      <para>Both men nodded and returned to their duty stations and continued
      working on their options</para>

      <para />

      <para>As he saw Heather leave the classified section of the lab he
      approached her, pretending that nothing was out of the ordinary. "May I
      have a word with you?"</para>

      <para>Heather looked at her friend and nodded, "Certainly handsome, what
      can I do for you?"</para>

      <para>Lopez looked a little uncomfortable as he said, "I need to see Dr.
      Lang tonight if at all possible. This is a matter of life and death.
      Can't tell you why though."</para>

      <para>Heather looked surprised and hurt at the same time... "So that's
      why you befriended me, just as a way to get close to uncle Emil, right?"
      Her face had turned a deep shade of crimson as she started yelling at
      the REF officer, growing more and more incoherent all the time.</para>

      <para>For the first time since they had met, Lopez seemed really angry
      with his friend. "I don't really have time for this... If you don't help
      me there are thousands of people who will die." He paused for a second
      and then added, in a more subdued tone, "I never intended to fall in
      love with you."</para>

      <para>Heather looked at Lopez with wide eyes, not saying anything. Lopez
      continued, "It's true I've not been completley honest with you.... I am
      not an ensign, but a LT. Colonel on the Robotech Expeditionary force,
      about 15 years from now."</para>

      <para>Heather's eyes grew wide for a second, then her voice grew hard,
      "So that's why you wanted to meet me and become my friend, isn't it?"
      She paused for a minute and then resumed. "Well, handsome, the only way
      you will get to see uncle Emil is over my dead body."</para>

      <para>Heather and Diego stared at each other for what seemed like an
      eternity, suddenly Diego Lopez said, "What if I can prove that what I'm
      saying is true?"</para>

      <para>Heather shook her head... less beligerant now and a litle more
      unsure of where she stood. "Where and how?"</para>

      <para>"Where you found me." Lopez was quick to reply. "The ship I came
      in will be hidden near the road where we first met." Lopez looked at
      Heather in silence, his look saying more than words ever could.</para>

      <para>Heather hesitated for a second and then nodded slowly. "Damn you
      Diego Lopez. Damn you and your showing up when I least expected it..."
      She paused again, her lower lip trembling, "Damn your for making me fall
      in love with you."</para>

      <para>Without another word they got into Heather's car and drove to the
      section of the highway where they'd first met. Once there, Lopez lead
      her to where the Legioss was hidden. The black ship was cool to the
      touch and, as he opened the cockpit, Lopez could see Heather shiver and
      he lips tremble.</para>

      <para>After a long silence, Heather spoke in a very low tone. "So it's
      true, you do come from the future and you really do need Uncle Emil's
      help."</para>

      <para>Lopez nodded slowly, "I really didn't mean for this to happen
      Heather. I did not plan for us to fall in love and I didn't plan not
      wanting to go back to my friends and my life." Lopez paused for a long
      time, "But it did happen and I promise that I will find a way to get you
      in my life again."</para>

      <para>They got back on the car and drove to Macross, to Dr. Lang's
      laboratory. The guard waved them through and they parked outside the
      Robotech Research Center and entered Dr. Lang's office. The office was
      immaculately clean, as if there was no one working there.</para>

      <para>"Uncle Emil..." Heather's voice was barely audible. "Uncle Emil,
      where are you?"</para>

      <para>Lopez withdrew his sidearm as he moved around the lab checking
      things out. Sudeenly a voice appearead, as if materializing from
      nowhere, "I am here Heather, what seems to be the problem?</para>

      <para>Heather shook her head, "No, there's no problem... but there's a
      friend of mine who needs you help and needs it now." Heather was quick
      to reply before she lost her nerve. Before the scientist could answer,
      Lopez moved out from behind the bench where he was standing and said,
      "Dr. Lang, there is no time for us to talk... we need your help and we
      need it now."</para>

      <para>If Lang was surprised or angry because of the interruption he
      didn't show it. He looked at Heather and her friend and asked, "What can
      I do for you?"</para>

      <para>"Dr. Lang, I need you to come with me, no questions asked... I can
      only say that this is really important." Lopez was direct and to the
      point, trying to convey his urgency to the man.</para>

      <para>Lang was unmoved, his eyes staring at both her niece and her
      friend with a mix of annoyance and curiosity. He finally said, "And this
      would involve and unidentified ship that was sighted 3 days ago in the
      vicinity of the island, would it not?"</para>

      <para>Lopez tried as hard as he could to hide the surprise but was not
      very successful. He tried to answer but Lang waved him off. "Do not
      worry, I've supressed the information from the RDF databases and
      archives." Lang again looked at the couple and asked again, "Where do
      you want us to go, mr..."</para>

      <para>My name is not important right now, Dr. Lang... We have several
      thousand people who are depending on getting you to a ship in orbit to
      the moon and do something with our engineers.</para>

      <para>"Let's go then... what are we waiting for?" Lang seemed full of
      energy and enthusiasm for someone who was being asked to go into the
      unknown. "I suppose you will be providing our transportation, will you
      not? Lopez nodded as he started walking towards the door, "It'll be the
      ride of a lifetime Doc, I can assure you that."</para>

      <para>The legioss fighter launched from its hiding place and picked up
      speed towards the rendevouz point with its mother ship. Lopez sat on the
      Alpha as he quietly thought about the events of the past 3 days while
      Lang and his niece sat on the Beta element, one wondering about the
      technology and the other one wondering what would happen with her
      life.</para>

      <para>The legioss had to battle its way trhough the heightened defenses
      of the moon bases and, although they couldn't be detected by radar, they
      had to avoid visual detection more than once. As they neared the
      Kitthawk, Lang and Heather heard Lopez voice call, "White Crane, This is
      Lucky 207 ready for landing at your convenience, over."</para>

      <para />

      <para>Jean Paul Williams came to where Sinclair was manning a
      surveillance console, just to have something different to do rahter than
      look around for people to panic. "Sir... things are getting
      serious."</para>

      <para>Sinclair had never heard his science officer worried before so he
      turned around quickly and asked, "What is it this time?" The face of the
      officer erased Sinclair's anger and replaced it with cold fear. "What's
      the problem, colonel?"</para>

      <para>The chief science officer nodded slowly. "Our life support
      reserves are down to the last 12, maybe 18 hours... if we don't hear
      from Col. Lopez by then we will have to lay in a course for the sun as
      we had originally planned, sir." For once Sinclair was glad that his
      officer was as calm as he was.</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded. "See if you can extend our life support any
      longer. We need to give Colonel Lopez more time."</para>

      <para>The next 8 hours where as tense as Sinclair had ever experienced.
      With the oxygen suppliew dwindling down, they had concetrated the crew
      on the upper decks of the ship and the bridge, waiting for their
      salvation...</para>

      <para>Sinclair was at the border of despair, he might have to order his
      ship and his people to death and that's something he had always tried to
      avoid as a commanding officer. As he was preparing to give the order and
      launch the Kittyhawk towards the sun, the radio came in with something
      Sinclair thought he'd never hear. "White Crane, this is Lucky ready for
      landing at your convenience, over."</para>

      <para>The flight controller's voice sounded even more joyful than usual,
      Lopez thought as he approached the ship. "You're cleared for landing as
      soon as possible on Landing Bay C. Welcome home handsome.</para>

      <para>As they were approaching the unknown ship Lang was deep in thought
      and analysis of the magnificent ship, wondering what technology would
      make something like this possible.</para>

      <para>Heather's heart skipped a beat when she heard the female voice
      from the flight controller refer to her friend as handsome and wondered
      what other parts of his world she wasn't familiar with...</para>

      <para>When the ship finally came to a stop teams of scientists and
      egineers were waiting for Lang to deplane and took him to engineering
      where they didn't take long to begin hooking the protoculture generators
      to the newer fold engines.... Soon they were engaged in interesting
      conversation as they worked on the generators.</para>

      <para>After 4 hours of work, Lang turned to the REF crew and said, "I
      think that's it... I am not sure there's anything else we can do." Lang
      shrugged... "I guess the only thing we have left is to try it,
      right?"</para>

      <para>No one realized that Lopez had taken Heather on a tour around the
      ship and that they had stopped on the observation deck. They held each
      other as the looked out the window and to the moon's surface. "Will this
      be the last time I see you, Diego?" Heather asked hopefully.</para>

      <para>"I know I will be in the SDF-1 in another two weeks, shortly
      before we fold." Lopez answered as truthfully as he could without
      telling her everything that would happen. "You can look for me on the
      arcades that will be near the base... I may not remember who you are but
      you must be persistent. Please be persistent."</para>

      <para>Heather nodded with tears in her eyes, "I promise I will..." She
      was going to say something else when a yeoman came and told them that it
      was time for Heather to return to Earth. They looked at each other and
      kissed very slowly and gently as if seeing each other for the first
      time.</para>

      <para>A yeoman came looking for them and told Heather that her ride back
      to earth was waiting for her and that it was time to go. They looked at
      each other one last time, neither of them knowing what to do or where to
      go from there</para>

      <para>Heather started to walk away towards the elevator on the other end
      of the observation deck before Diego stopped her and walked with her to
      the elevator where the stood next to each other. Before the elevator's
      doors opened, Heather kissed Diego Lopez as she'd never kissed anyone
      before and whispered, "Don't say anything handsome... I would much
      rather remember you like this..." and she walked to the Legioss that
      would be taking her and her uncle back to Macross.</para>

      <para>The Legioss took off and the countdown began for the ship's
      attempt to return to their proper time. Lopez remained on the deck until
      the fighter was lost behind the moon. As he started walking back to the
      observation he let out a long sigh.</para>

      <para />

      <para>A couple hours later everything was ready for the attempt to fold.
      The Avalon had been towed inside the Kittyhawk and everything was as
      ready as it was ver going to be, thought Sinclair as he strapped to his
      command chair. The voice from the chief engineer filtered through
      indicating that his group was ready; moments later the voice of the
      science officer came through indicating that the astorgation
      calculations were done and that they were ready.</para>

      <para>Pull pin and throw, thought Sinclair even as he gave the command
      to engage the fold drive. The universe seemed to contract on itself
      again as the groans and moans of the bridge crew grew louder and louder
      before being replaced by silence...</para>

      <para>Did we make it? was Sinclair's first thought as he regained
      conciousness. After several minutes of silence he was able to order
      emergency lights on the bridge. "Bridge to engineering, status
      report?"</para>

      <para>A runner came to the bridge with a paper note from the engineer.
      It was short and to the point. 'We're out of protoculture... will atempt
      to extend life support... let you know what I can do'</para>

      <para>"Attention unknown ship, this is the RSS Coral Sea..." There was a
      large pause, then the message was repeated again with the additional
      warning that if there was no answer the Coral Sea would open fire. As I
      was getting ready for calling the crew to brace for impact, the comm
      system came to life and he communicated with his ship. "Coral Sea, this
      is the RSS Kittyhawk, repeat this is the Kitty Hawk, hold your
      fire..."</para>

      <para>They had finally made it home...</para>

      <para>"We've restore minimal power, sir... we've initiated the trip
      under sublight engines," reported the chief engineer. "We should be back
      in aquaria within 48 hour."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded, "Good job, Yoshio... let me know if there's any
      other problem." He paused for several seconds, "Ask commander Cameron to
      see me at her convenience and also pass the word that the Kittyhawk crew
      will recieve a meritory service award." Another pause.
      "Dismissed."</para>

      <para>The officer nodded and left the room. Sinclair remained on his
      desk and wondered what else would happen before they could return to
      Earth. He shook his head as Megan entered the office. "Commander Megan
      Cameron reporting as ordered General."</para>

      <para>Sinclair was taken aback by the formality, he decided to respond
      in kind. "Just wanted to congratulate you and inform you that you've
      been recommended for the REF Medal of honor for your
      performance."</para>

      <para>Megan shrugged and replied, "I don't see that I deserve it, sir. I
      did what anyone else would have done if given the chance."</para>

      <para>The looked at each other for a long time. There was a lot that
      they each wanted to say, yet the silence grew longer and longer. It was
      Sinclair who broke it saying, "There's a party at my home when we return
      to Aquaria. I would love for you to attend, if you're
      interested."</para>

      <para />

      <para>Colonel Lopez had waited for what it seemed like an eternity
      before the Kittyhawk's troops were allowed to take the shuttles to
      Aquaria's surface. His mind was lost in thoughts of what might have been
      and what future he did not have with Heather and how different his life
      might have been because of it.</para>

      <para>As the shuttle landed, Lopez made his way back to his quarters
      lost in thought. When he entered the sparsely decorated room, his hand
      went to his sidearm, something looked different and he couldn't point
      out what it was.</para>

      <para>There were paintings hung all over the room. Some of the paintings
      were of him in his RDF flight suit, some others were of him with a girl
      next to him, some where of the girl. Lopez walked to one of the
      paintings of the couple and suddenly it hit him. She looked a little
      different but it was Heather all right. My god, muttered Lopez as he
      walked to the bedroom's closet. Once there he opened a large white box
      where he had put all of his wife's personal things after she
      died.</para>

      <para>His hands were trembling already anticipating what would happen.
      The box was filled with mementos of a life he was now starting to
      remember; pictures, weding invitations, promotion ceremonies invitations
      and more somber thing, a death certificate, a compassion leave
      authorization note and a note from Alex Sinclair expressing condolences
      as C.O. of the Black Knights. There was also a letter addressed to
      him.</para>

      <para>Lopez went back to the pictures. Some of them where taken at the
      time he was stationed in California as part of the RDF commitment to
      North American defense. Some of ther pictures were taken while he was
      stationed aboard the ARMD-23, the Akagi. There was also a picture taken
      on the day of his promotion to Major.</para>

      <para>Lopez then opened the letter; it was written in Heather's regular
      handwriting. It was dated January 10th, 2010; shortly after they'd met.
      Lopez began reading it...</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>Diego:</para>

        <para>I just wanted to say that being with you is the most wonderful
        thing that has ever hapened to me. Regardless of the weird
        circumstances that brought us together I'm very happy that it
        did.</para>

        <para>As you told me more than once, never forget that I've loved you
        with all my heart and that I'll always be watching over you. Also know
        that you'll always have a place in my heart, no matter what happens
        between us and no matter how crazy the world around us become.</para>

        <para>Love you with all my heart,</para>

        <para>Heather</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>Lopez sat on his bed dumbfounded for hours before taking a shower,
      walking out of his quarters and walking to the flightline at Fokker
      Base. There he went directly to the duty officer and said, "I am taking
      my Alpha on patrol... have it ready."</para>

      <para>The duty officer looked confused, "But... sir, you're not on the
      flight duty roster for today... I'll have to check with command."</para>

      <para>Lopez looked at the flight duty officer and was very careful in
      enunciating, "If you don't get my "Memphis Belle" ready to fly in the
      next 5 minutes, I will make sure that all you fly for the rest of your
      military career is a garbage collector on the Tirolian Garbage Company.
      Do I make myself perfectly clear, Lieutenant?"</para>

      <para>The officer winced hard a couple times before saying, "Yes, sir,"
      and saluting right out of the book.</para>

      <para>Once Lopez got to his alpha, nicknamed Memphis Belle, and climbed
      aboard there was another suprise waiting for him. There was a small
      photo of Heather...</para>

      <para>"I guess things will be different from now on." Thought Lopez as
      his fighter took off and headed to the training area.</para>

      <para />

      <para>The house was as full as Alexander remembered it being, the food
      was already out and people were engaged in polite conversation. As the
      last person arrived, Alex moved to the center of the room and raised his
      voice and brought all the people's attention to him. "Ladies and
      gentlement may I have your attention, please."</para>

      <para>The conversations gradually stopped as people turned towards
      Sinclair and waited for him to speak. He didn't make them wait long, "I
      just wanted to say that I've never had a crew I've been more proud of.
      You people have done the impossible and have done it twice." There was a
      pause. Sinclair wanted them to understand what they'd done before moving
      on. "I want you to transmit to your people that they've done a great job
      and that they should be proud of it." There was another pause, "That's
      about all, resume the party. Enjoy yourselves, you've earned it."</para>

      <para>The small groups returned to the conversations and Sinclair joined
      Yoshio Kodama, chief engineer of the Kittyhawk; Megan Cameron, commander
      of the Kittyhawk air group; José Miguel Lehuedé communications engineer
      and department lead for that group aboard the Kittyhawk; Diego Lopez,
      commander of the Tiger Sharks; Anna Paulova, military specialist with
      the Tiger Sharks and Steve Connor, commander of Task Group 28.2. As
      usual, the conversation migrated to military themes.</para>

      <para>"I think that the global war could have been avoided with a little
      more pressure from the United States, sir. The actions were too serious
      to be taken that easy, without analysis." Countered Paulova.</para>

      <para>"That may as well be true, but if the rest of the world's powers
      had not behaved like little children and bickered against each other
      while the rest of the world was tearing itself to pieces the result
      would have been very different." General Connor's replied...</para>

      <para>"With all due respect, general." Sinclair saw that Paulova was
      choosing the words she was going to use. "It was the generals of the
      NORAD command who ignored the signs of war and moved to their
      underground bunkers to direct a war they could have prevented."</para>

      <para>"Now wait a minute, Sergeant." General Connors' voice began to
      grow agitated. "There were more factors there than what either of us
      know... it is not fair to pin the blame into the generals." Sinclair saw
      the discussion heating up and walked towards the group. His voice was
      cordial yet firm when he spoke. "Ladies and gentlemen, food is going to
      be ready in a few minutes. Should we go get it?"</para>

      <para>Connors looked at the NCO pilot with a less than friendly face as
      they moved towards the grill. The food was great and the conversaion,
      thankfully, went in other directions.</para>

      <para />

      <para>The house was dark and there was some noise coming up from the
      living room. Megan was worried that something had happened to her
      commanding officer and friend as she walked to the room where the noise
      came from. There was a glow on the screen and people siting down casting
      a shadow on the tv screen.</para>

      <para>"General Sinclair are you ok?" Megan called with growing
      aprehension. She was about to call security when Sinclair's voice came
      from the couch and said, "Captain Cameron, come on in.... Would you have
      something to drink with me?"</para>

      <para>"General Sinclair, sir." Megan's voice sounded relieved, "I came
      to offer an apology." Megan was dressed up on a tanktop and a pair of
      cutoff jeans.</para>

      <para>Sinclair paused the movie as he looked at Megan paying a little
      more attention this time. "You don't owe me anything captain... whatever
      happened, I'm sure you had a reason for it." Sinclair motioned for Megan
      to sit down and enjoy the movie with him.</para>

      <para>Megan sat down as requested and started paying attention at the
      movie; it was Casablanca with Ingrid Bergmman and Humphrey Boggart. When
      they returned to the movie, Ilsa Lund had just come to visit Rick at his
      cafe after hours and demanded for the passes so she and husband could
      run away from ocuppied France. Rick played it tough but in the end they
      both confessed that they were still in love with each other.</para>

      <para>"Patricia and I loved this movie and watched it together as often
      as we could." Sinclair's voice was barely above a whisper, "We first saw
      it after we met in Macross Island, right before the Zentraedi
      invaded."</para>

      <para>The movie continued in silence. The Lazlos had made it to the
      airport and Rick had shot the German officer who had tried to keep the
      Lazlos in town. They had heard Rick's monologue about the problems of
      three little people not ammounting to a hill of beans in this crazy
      world. Megan heard Alex take a deep breath... yet reamin silent. The
      movie ended with the french police officer and Rick running together to
      join the French resistance.</para>

      <para>As Alex brought the lights back on, he saw that Megan had been
      crying during the movie. "Is there anything wrong Megan?"</para>

      <para>She cleaned the tears from her face and shook her head.
      "Everything is fine, Alex. The movie brought up some memories that I
      thought I'd put behind me..."</para>

      <para>Alexander Sinclair nodded slowly, waiting for Megan to continue...
      There was a long silence as he put another DVD on the player. It was the
      final episode of Cowboy Bebop... the one where everything is resolved
      and everything becomes even more blury.</para>

      <para>"About that apology I owe you sir..." Megan started but stopped
      herself for a couple seconds, then continued. "I was... am afraid...
      of... getting close to anyone." There was another long pause. "My fiance
      died on the assault of Tirol... he was a veritech pilot assigned to VF
      102."</para>

      <para>"I'm sorry Megan..." Sinclair said in a quiet voice. as the movie
      played on. Spike had just returned to the Bebop in order to prepare
      himself for his final battle... Faye stops him.</para>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>

      <para>The movie progressed in silence, neither Megan or Alex said
      anything until the final credits started rolling and the closing song
      began playing. Alex turned the lights on and looked at Megan with new
      found respect on his eyes... she returned the look with more
      understanding that she had shown in the past.</para>

      <para>Alex asked Megan if she wanted anything to drink; She answered
      that she'd take a gin and tonic. When sinclair stood up to prepare the
      drinks, Megan walked behind him and hugged his waist while laying her
      head on his back... "Thanks, Alex." Her voice was barely above a
      whisper....</para>

      <para>They sipped their drinks; his a bourbon on the rocks, hers a gin
      and tonic. They looked at each other for a while without saying anyting
      and then suddenly she kissed him. It was a simple and tender kiss
      between two people who want to get close to each other. They held each
      other for a long time and then let got reluctantly.</para>

      <para>They put another movie into the DVD player. The held each other
      closely as the movie played. It was an old movie called Cocktail where
      the couple has a series of misunderstandings, including the fact that
      she's the daughter of a millionaire. In the end dreams come true and
      they get together and are ready to form a family. When the movie ended,
      Megan stood up and started walking to the door... "I think it's better
      if I go. We have a troop review tomorrow at 0700 and it's already
      midnight."</para>

      <para>Sinclair reluctantly nodded. "Do you want to meet for lunch
      tomorrow at the Officer's Club?"</para>

      <para />

      <para>The review was conducted in silence but Task Group 28.3's
      commanders didn't need words to know that the Task Force commander was
      not happy at all. Once the inspection was over, Sinclair ordered
      Brigadier General Michael Cameron to a conference room.</para>

      <para>"I never thought I was going to say this but I'm terribly
      dissapointed Michael." Sinclair began his evaluation. For the next 3
      hours he gave his sometimes acid comments about the preparedness of this
      group of troops under his command. Then he began his "Homework
      Assignment" for the Task Group's commander.</para>

      <para>"I want the pilots on this group to be ready to launch within 3
      minutes of an alert being called and out protecting your warships within
      5." Sinclair began... "Any less than that jeopardizes your crews and
      your ships uneccessarily." The commander of the Task Group nodded. He
      knew the task ahead of him would be hard but he also knew that his
      commanding officer had a good reason to do what he was doing.</para>

      <para>"However, once your people were out they were good at dealing with
      the simulated Invid troopers in combat." Sinclair tried to end AARs in a
      positive not so as not to create resentment on the officers under
      review. "Your civil defense people also deserve a tip of the hat... they
      did a wonderful job." There was a short paused after which the task
      group's leadership was dismissed.</para>

      <para>Captain Cameron had finished similar reviews of the task group's
      flight squadrons and entered when prompted to do so. She laid a report
      down on the desk and shook her head. "I knew we needed the shakeup but I
      never thought it'd be this bad."</para>

      <para>Sinclair raised an eyebrow. "How bad is it?"</para>

      <para>"It could be worse." Megan shrugged, "Some of the squadrons have
      been put in probation and are required to improve their performances by
      as much as a hundred percent before they will be allowed to requalify as
      spaceborne squadrons." Slight pause, "There was only one squadron
      suspended, but one is bad enough."</para>

      <para>The tactical officer's voice was slightly higher pitched now.
      "Bandits. Multiple battle pods have launched ahead of our contacts." A

      <para>Sinclair kept a calm voice. "Launch all our fighters and stand by

      <para>"This is Avenger Six Actual to all units, prepare for combat. Open
      fire as soon as you have positive identification on the enemy." Lt.
      Colonel McQueen arrayed his forces against the expected enemy.</para>

      <para>The Zentraedi did not make the defenders wait and attacked in
      massive numbers looking to overwhelm the defenders with one massive
      application of power. Soon, the battle had degenerated to melee combat
      between mecha as Gladiators went hand to hand with Zentraedi soldiers in
      power armor and the excalibers did their part in pouding battlepods to
      pieces.</para>

      <para>Gunnery Sergeant Vladimir Ivanov's gladiator mecha went hand to
      hand with a Zentraedi trooper in power armor and ripped the armor off
      the trooper's chest and disabled the enemy, only to be shot at point
      blank range by another Zentraedi's particle bean cannon.</para>

      <para>Inch by inch the REF forces repulsed the first enemy attack,
      although they paid a heavy price. The bodies of several REF troopers on
      Gladiators and Cyclones littered the battlefield along with the debris
      from Zentraedi mecha destroyed in the battle.</para>

      <para>"All units estabilish permiter and stand down. We'll do patrols in
      2 hour rotations." McQueen ordered, hoping it would be enough.</para>

      <para />

      <para>The ship shook violently as the Kitty Hawk's shields absorbed
      another hit from an enemy warship. Other ships of the Task Force were
      not faring as well as the flagship.</para>

      <para>"Sir, the Ranger reports heavy damage. Commander Harrison requests
      permission to withdraw." The comm officer reported to a worried General
      Sinclair...</para>

      <para>"Order all our forces to withdraw if possible." Sinclair said
      after a short pause. "Prepare the plasma cannon to fire and notify me
      when it's ready." Sinclair was formulating the battle strategy as he
      thought it aloud. "Have the fighter wings disengage from combat as soon
      as we're ready to fire and then re-engage the enemy as they see fit;
      Have the other capital ships move to point blank range..." Sinclair
      added and then in a mumur added, "They may take us out but they will
      take some of their own along with us."</para>

      <para>"Aye, aye sir." The tactical officer began preparations to follow
      the orders he'd just received. While the capital ships pounded each
      other to atoms, the fighters and battle pods danced between the ships as
      if in a mad race against death and each other.</para>

      <para>"Two enemy destroyers have been neutralized." The Ranger has
      withdrawn and the Coral Sea reports damage to their engines and is
      effecting repairs as we speak." The report kept going continued with
      damage and casualty reports. Sinclair cut the reporter off and ordered
      the plan to be executed.</para>

      <para />

      <para>"Move the infantry closer, we will need their support soon."
      Colonel McQueen barked over the tactical communication network. "We will
      be having Zentraedi to the party and it wouldn't do for us not to be
      there to greet them." Seconds turned into minutes when suddenly a voice
      broke into the network. "Avenger lead, this is Joseph 5." Joseph 5 was a
      military specialist clad in a VR-141 Cylone armor who had been shadowing
      the enemy for the past 8 hours.</para>

      <para>"Go ahead Joseph 5." McQueen wished he could feel as confident as
      his voice projected. The report made his blood chill.</para>

      <para>"There are 50, that is five-zero enemy units approaching your
      position, they are primarily tactical battle pods and officer pods,
      supported by light and heavy artillery units. Will withdraw according to
      plan." The female voice had that undistinguishable aura of fear around
      her.</para>

      <para>"Roger, Joseph 5. Proceed according to plan." McQueen cut the link
      off and prayed that the captain who was Joseph 5 survived. She'd make a
      wonderful field intelligence officer with time and the proper
      training.</para>

      <para>There was a brief click acknowledging the order and nothing more.
      Then the wait began as people found creative ways of keeping themselves
      alert for the coming combat. One of the outside pickets broke the
      monotony when he reported that the contacts were at the outer perimeter
      and that they had recovered all the Joseph units.</para>

      <para>"Attention all units, this is Avenger Six." McQueen spoke calmly
      into his microphone, trying to instill confidence on his troops. "The
      enemy units are almost here. The code word is Containment. We will
      execute plan Containment on first contact with the enemy." McQueen
      shudered at having to order that particular mission. When originally
      devised, operation Containment was developed as a tripwire mission to
      slow down the enemy while reinforcements arrived to contain and
      eliminate the threat; but with all surrounding units engaged, those
      reinforcements would be long time in coming. He communicated his
      intentions to his superiors and then settled for the incoming
      assault.</para>

      <para>The Zentraedi commander didn't make the REF forces wait and
      launched his remaining forces against the REF squadron patrolling the
      area. The battle pods were everywhere and the REF soldiers had to shoot
      anything that moved.</para>

      <para>The battle once again degenerated to a blood bath. The smaller
      Cylones darted everywhere, avoiding the bigger Zentraedi machines and
      causing as much damage as possible. The bigger machines pounded each
      other at close, and sometimes pointblank, range causing large explosions
      and leveling entire city blocks.</para>

      <para>a group of 4 Cyclone-clad pilots attacked a much larger Zentraedi
      heavy artillery battle pod and blew it to pieces before the Zentraedi
      soldier could launch his missiles.</para>

      <para>A REF gladiator, having run out of ammunition went head to head
      with a Zentraedi soldier in power armor and was blown to pieces when
      attacked with the Zentraedi's impact cannon.</para>

      <para>Zentraedi soldiers who had left their damaged battle pods and
      pressed their attack with assault rifles. The hand to hand combat grew
      more violent and savage as both sides realized that they were playing
      for keeps.</para>

      <para>The REF foces gave ground little by little while they destroyed
      the enemy mecha and warriors pushing them. Both sides had suffered heavy
      cassualties but the REF forces seemed to be gaining the upper
      hand.</para>

      <para />

      <para>The Kitty Hawk's plasma cannon fired and destroyed 2 enemy
      warships. Sinclair saw this and ordered all warships to reconfigure for
      anti-fighter defense.</para>

      <para>The remaining Zentraedi warships began to pull out of the combat
      arena as their numbers began to grow smaller, meanwhile the Zentraedi
      pods and fighters provided a covering force before the ships were able
      to fold out of the combat theater.</para>

      <para>"Sir, it seems like the enemy is withdrawing and attempting to
      fold." The tactical officer reported to Sinclair. "Fighters and pods
      seem to be providing cover.</para>

      <para>"How are our ground forces faring?" Sinclair asked next. He was
      concerned that the withdrawal was a faint and that they'd fold to the
      other side of the system where they would launch a new attack. "Assign
      the California and Iowa to trail the ships."</para>

      <para>The two ships detached from the Task Force's fleet and moved to a
      point where they could shadow their prey as the rest of the REF ships
      moved closer to engage the retreating Zentraedi.</para>

      <para>"Our surface forces report that all the Zentraedi warrior are
      pulling out." Tactical reported. "Our lead units request permission to
      pursue and engage."</para>

      <para>"No, commander. Instruct all our forces to pull back for rest and
      refit. We have no way of knowing if the retreat is a trap or not... and
      I want us to be ready in case our friends decide to come back.</para>

      <para>After a brief pause, Sinclair ordered his shuttle to be made ready
      for a trip down to Aquaria to inspect damages.</para>

      <para />

      <para>As suddenly as they appeared, the Zentraedi forces began their
      retreat. Some of the REF fighters requested permission to follow but
      McQueen denied their requests. "People, I want us to reload and stand
      ready for another assault... Task Force Command indicated that they may
      be back without notice. Word is that additional troops from the ships in
      orbit are coming down to relieve us. We are to stand down for R &amp;
      R."</para>

      <para>As the reinforcements arrived and the troopers who had been in
      combat stood down, Colonel McQueen spoke a few words with some of the
      mess specialists and they nodded in apreciation; they came back several
      minutes later carrying large boxes.</para>

      <para>McQueen called everyone to him. "Listen up! You people have a hell
      of a job and I want you to know that I'm proud." He had to stop because
      of the loud cheers. "I expect the best and I give the best." He opened
      the cases and took out the first keg of beer. "Enjoy yourselves, that's
      an order!</para>

      <para>As the party got underway, Colonel McQueen returned to his command
      post to help organize the recovery efforts. Someone tapped his shoulder
      and as he turned he saw general Sinclair standing there, overseeing and
      evaluating the situation. McQueen drew to attention and saluted.
      "Situation under control. Humanitarian and rescue operations will begin
      within the hour. The soldiers involved in heavy combat have been given a
      stand down for the time being."</para>

      <para>Sinclair nodded approvingly. "Good job colonel.... I want you to
      pass the word to the troops." Sinclair looked at the city map and the
      markers for the different reconstruction efforts to be undertaken.
      "Where's the party?" He asked a couple minutes later.</para>

      <para>McQueen was surprised by the question. "Beg the general's
      pardon?"</para>

      <para>Sinclair looked half amused, "Come on Colonel... I know there is a
      party somewhere in this area and I'd like to know where." Sinclair eyes
      twinkled with mischief.</para>

      <para>Colonel McQueen lead general Sinclair to the party site and
      Sinclair did his best not to call atention on to himself. He shared
      drinks and fun with the soldiers who had fought so valiantly against the
      invader. Some of the soldiers recognized him and tried to salute but the
      general waved the salutes off saying that they were soldiers, rank
      didn't matter.</para>

      <para>After a couple hours of mingling, Sinclair called them to
      attention. "Listen up people. I just wanted to say that you did one hell
      of a job and that a lot of commendations will be coming out of this
      one." Long pause, "Continue the party, and enjoy yourselves. That's an
      order!"</para>

      <para>Sinclair left the party to return to Gloval base and the mess that
      this assault had caused.</para>

      <para />

      <para>As Sinclair walked into the command center the crew was in a
      frenzy with all the details involved in coordinating the rescue efforts
      already underway and keeping track of the two Aurora class starships
      that were trailing the enemy.</para>

      <para>"Status report" Sinclair asked as he reached the command
      blacony.</para>

      <para>"Search and rescue missions are progressing as well as can be
      expected. There are more survivors than we initially estimated and the
      resources of the medical group are taxed to the limit." The officer of
      the watch reported. "We have a task group on standing alert to repel any
      additional assaults." There was a brief interruption as a yeoman gave
      something to the officer of the watch who read it before continuing.
      "Cassualty reports are starting to come in from our ground forces and
      they are not good. A lot of the wounded are serious enough to be
      sidelined for weeks and maybe months."</para>

      <para>Sinclair took all this in with a lot calmer than he felt at the
      moment. "First priority goes to search and rescue, the second is to
      rebuild our installations and military units so we can repel any future
      invasion attempts."</para>

      <para>There was a brief pause as Sinclair looked over his staff's
      shoulders at the casaulty reports and repair estimates for the ships of
      the Task Force's fleet. He counted his blessings that cassualties had
      not been higher and knew that whoever had done this had to pay the
      price. "Please have all the task group commanders meet in briefing room
      3 in 45 minutes..."</para>

      <para>45 minutes later the senior task force leadership was assembled
      for what was sure to be a brutal AAR. Sinclair was sitting on his chair
      at the head of the table.</para>

      <para>"Ok people. What the hell happened?" Sinclair was straight to the
      point and wanted answers that would save other people's lives in the
      future.</para>

      <para>"I have to admit that we got caught with our pants down." General
      Connors answered first. "Our level of readiness was not as high as it
      should have been and as you requested on our last readiness review." His
      face was a mix of regret and shame.</para>

      <para>"It also seems like the Zentraedi knew where to fold in order to
      avoid our automated warning system." The commander of the civil defense
      forces added. "If we didn't have Mountain Home in orbit we would have
      been pounded even worse."</para>

      <para>"I want task groups 28.1 and 28.4 ready to go within 2 hours to
      support the ships trailing the Zentraedi attackers." Sinclair ordered
      next. "I want reports of how to improve our defenses on my desk by the
      end of the day tomorrow. Any questions?" There were none.
      "Dismissed."</para>

      <para>"The Zentraedi warships are releasing battlepods." The report came
      from a ELINT/SIGINT legioss attached to the first attack wave. "Here
      they come."</para>

      <para>The pods and veritech fighters engaged, once more, in their dance
      of death as they darted between the capital ships only now coming in
      range of their weapons. The sky light up with laser cannon and particle
      beams as the capital ships attempted to destroy one another.</para>

      <para>A flight of veritech fighters closed on a Zentraedi destroyer and
      unloaded their ordinance into the ship's weak spots revealed to the RDF
      by Zentraedi defectors after the First Robotech War. The ship exploded
      in a huge ball of plasma and debris taking several of the fighters who
      couldn't get out of the explosion on time.</para>

      <para>The RSS Coral Sea, an Ikazuchi-class cruiser closed in with
      another Zentraedi destroyer and opened fire with all her weapons,
      oblivious to the enemy pods firing on her. The Okinawa, Coral Sea's
      sister ship, joined her firepower in destroying the Zentraedi
      warship.</para>

      <para>The REF and Zentraedi forces were as evenly matched as they could
      possibly be eventhough the REF forces were heavily damaged. The combat
      continued as a slugging match until general Sinclair's ships arrived to
      tilt the balance in the REF's favor. The appearance of two task groups
      of fresh troops and warships signaled the end of the Zentraedi
      threat.</para>

      <para>The Kitty Hawk moved in to engage the Zentraedi flagship and
      opened fire with all the weapons available to her except for the plasma
      cannon. The Zentraedi commander saw the situation as a loss and opened
      up with all the weapons she had available to, at least, go out in a
      blaze of glory.</para>

      <para>"Sir, enemy flagship is coming on a collision course.... I think
      they are going to ram us." The voice of the Kitty Hawk's tactical
      officer was barely containing the panic...</para>

      <para>There was a long silence as more and more damage reports came
      through the tactical network. Sinclair ordered the Plasma Cannon ready
      to fire.</para>

      <para>The ships kept closing the distance separating them as if intent
      on anihilating each other. The tactical officer aboard the Kitty Hawk
      counted the time remaining before the two flagships would collide.
      Suddenly, Sinclair ordered the plasma cannon to be fired and the full
      barrier system activated.</para>

      <para>The explosion rocked the KittyHawk and caused small explosions as
      the debris overloaded the barrier system. "Damage report." Sinclair
      ordered after the ship stopped rocking. "Heavy damage, all sections.
      Ship is still spaceworthy but won't be able to take much more damage,
      sir."</para>

      <para>The fight continued as the remaining Zentraedi warships decided to
      go down fighting. It was not uncommon for other 2 or 3 REF ships to
      surruound the Zentraedi and broadcast demands for surrender on their own
      language. Sadly it was not unusual for the Zentraedi to ignore the
      request and continue fighting until they were destroyed.</para>

      <para>It was hours before the tactical officer was able to report the
      last Zentraedi ship was destroyed. The relief was tangible among the
      crew of the Task Force's flagship. "Take us back to Mountain Home, Mr.
      Ishikawa.... Take us home."</para>

			<para>"Captain Cameron, assemble a team for planetary reconsaisance
			and assualt." General Sinclair ordered, "I'll join you in planetary
			reconsaisance." Colonel John Brightling shook his head, "General, SOP
			indicates that a commanding officer is not to land on a planetary
			surface unless a recon force has already landed and a security
			perimeter has been established".</para>
			
			<para>"You can log in your protest if you so desire, John." Sinclair
			replied. "It's been long enough since the last time I lead a mission
			so I am going and that's it." Colonel Brightling nodded knowing it was
			impossible to argue with his commanding officer.</para>
			
			<para>Sinclair turned to captain Cameron and issued his order to
			prepare a assault team for planetary operations. She nodded as she
			left the command room to execute her orders.</para>

			<para>Sinclair strapped in on his alpha fighter, the black widow, as
			the rest of the assault team moved in to their assigned fighters and
			assault transports. "Attention assault team, this is Lead. We are
			ready for launching." Because of his lack of flight time Sinclair had
			refused to take command of the mission but rather fly as the number 6
			fighter in the assault team.</para>
			
			<para>"Lead, this is Assault-6, ready for launch." As the veritechs
			and shuttles assigned to the assault team launched, they adopted an
			assault formation and moved towards the planet.</para>
			
			<para>"Everything checks normal." The mission commander on board the
			shuttle informed Mountain Home and the rest of the team. "Proceed with
			orbital reconsaisance."Sinclair and the other fighters droped to
			planetary orbit and began scans of the surface. Strangely the scans
			came out blank.... Not like there was a clean signal, but more like
			there was no signal at all.</para>
			
			<para>"Escort flight, let's try a concentrated scan of the surface."
			The voice of the mission commander came through the speakers. The
			Betas of the escort squadron initiated a high-power scan of the
			planetary surface with the same result. The mission commander
			hesitated before ordering the team to begin a surface
			reconaisance. "Attention all ships of the escort group, prepare to
			land on the planet."</para>
			
			<para>As the ships adopted planetary landing formation the pilots
			informed that their systems were failing; that all protoculture
			related equipment was non-functional. The veritechs initiated
			unpowered landing attempts and the shuttle got ready for a hard
			landing.</para>
			
			<para>As the shuttle crashed the crew saw the veritechs littering the
			surface, their landing attempts having been mostly successful. The
			warriors took their cyclones off the downed aircraft and assembled for
			instructions. "Ok, people. Our mecha seems to be down. Let's see if we
			can get the backup systems online." The mission commander turned to
			Sinclair. "General, according to SOP, once the mission is on the
			ground command reverts to the senior officer present, sir."</para>
			
			<para>Sinclair grimaced and nodded before evaluating the personel who
			had landed with him, then he started giving orders. "Captain
			Cameron. Please check whether the figters are operational and get the
			cyclones out and ready to move out." He turned to the squadron
			commander. "Commander Lewis. See if we can raise the Kitty Hawk and
			appraise them of our situation. The rest of us will make ourselves
			comfortable and see what we are dealing with." Sinclair turned to his
			own alpha to get the cyclone out.</para>
			
			<para>The news were mixed. On the one hand they couldn't raise the
			Kitty Hawk on any channel but they could move the veritechs and the
			cyclones on auxiliary power.</para>
			
			<para>"Let's hide the veritechs and set up camp." Sinclair ordered. "It
			looks like we're going to be here for a while." He then motioned for
			the escort commander, captain Megan Cameron, and Lt. Commander Neal
			Andrews, the mission commander for a strategy session.</para>
			
			<para>Sinclair looked grim, he asked if they had planetary maps. Some
			barebones map were produced and some additional marks pere put where
			surveys had indicated settlements. Sinclair decided to head for the
			closes settlement for supplies and information. They mounted the
			cyclones and got ready for action. "Check weapons." Sinclair ordered
			before he mounted his cyclone.... It didn't surprise Sinclair to hear
			that no weapon were working. Sinclair walked to his alpha's storage
			compartment and took two bundles out of it, he then put the bundles on
			one of his saddlebags before moving out with the rest of the team.</para>
			
			<para>As they moved to the town, Sinclair sent scouts ahead to asses
			the danger the town presented to the REF troops. Once they reported
			the area to be clear, Sinclair moved the rest of the team forward. The
			town was an almost exact copy of an early-20-century rural village;
			the only strange thing was that it appeared to be deserted.</para>
			
			<para>"Fan out and search for survivors." Sinclair ordered as his
			troops fanned out to complete the orders. The town appeared to be
			deserted with no survivors. "Seems that someone prepared the house for
			us and the have to leave.... " Captain Cameron commented, "Select two
			houses for us to stay, establish a security perimeter with 4 hours
			relays."</para>
			
			<para>The REF forces settled down for the night. As they did sinclair
			brought his two bundles off the cyclone and opened them. The weapons
			they contained were not REF standard issue and it was apparent that
			they had been in his posession for a long time.</para>
			
			<para>Megan Cameron moved close to her commander officer to see what
			he was carrying. She saw her commandin officer lovingly working on
			polishng a blade and getting a larger staff off one of the bags. She
			walked towards him and asked, "What are those, sir?"</para>
			
			<para>Sinclair jumped, startled at her words, took the blade out of

			<para>"That's why you go to the dojo every week when you're in

			"One is a katana and the other one is a naginata... a longer
			halberd-like weapon." I've been learning both weapons for the last 35

		<chapter>
		<title>The Beginning</title>
		
		<para>
		<emphasis role="bold">
		From a lecture by Octavius Cameron, Tutor to the
		Council
		</emphasis>
		</para>
		
		<para>
		Man has always sought to control that which he can not
		possess.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		Ever since the first man used fire, or the wheel or the
		printing press there has always been people ready and
		willing to exploit others for personal gain. Fortunately
		there is also someone who is ready to protect mankind
		from itself. The battle has been ongoing for more than
		5000 years and there is still no discernible winner.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The early story of the order is sketchy, the records
		would have to be as old as the orders themselves and no
		known document has survived that long. Our best guesses
		indicate that the first members of the orders gathered
		with like minded individuals as they discovered their
		differences; If the world at large had discovered our
		ancestors they would have surely killed them because of
		fear.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The White Council and the Brotherhood grew. They battled
		for new members among those who developed 'abilities'
		such as 'moving things without touching them', 'speaking
		to people who were far away', or the ability to bend the
		world to their wills, something that normals would later
		call 'magic'.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		Throughout history these two all-powerful organizations
		have acted as check and balances for each other. Neither
		group wanted to be discovered by normal humans for they
		were convinced that humanity would utterly destroy them
		and their abilities. The methods each group employed
		were drastically different. Where the Council worked
		behind the scenes, slowly and gently influencing public
		opinion and the political leadership of their adopted
		countries the Brotherhood used paramilitary forces and,
		where it was appropriate, the political opposition to
		the elected rulers. Sufficient to say that the
		Brotherhood's methods caused untold misery and
		destruction despite the Council's best efforts at
		containment.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		It wasn't long before wizards and gifted members of each
		group realized that they were not alone in the
		supernatural world. None in the Council could place
		these new supernatural forces but it was clear that
		there was something out there hindering their efforts.
		It would be several years before the Council would
		discover who this new force was.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		World War II was a watershed event in the war between
		the Council and the Brotherhood. It marked the first
		open confrontation between the two groups occurred. The
		Brotherhood's battle wizards, people trained to use
		their 'magic' as a combat tool rather than as a way to
		help people, caught the Council unprepared and cost the
		lives of several promising council members.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The debate within the Council following this attack was
		fierce. Some believed that the Brotherhood's direct
		action spelled the end of the Council as it could never
		retaliate in kind, the gifts given to its members were
		only to be used for the betterment of mankind. Others
		argued that the Brotherhood's new methods called for the
		Council to answer in kind; that it would break the
		Council's obligation if they were to hide and do
		nothing. Radical needs demanded radical methods.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The vote was close; some say too close. In the end the
		Council authorized the training of a cadre of battle
		wizards to be known as 'The Hand of The Council'. Their
		mandate was to seek out and confront the Brotherhood
		wizards whenever they appeared and to attempt to
		minimize the damage their opponents caused. They would
		only be answerable to the inner circle of the Council
		and punishable by them and them alone.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The balance was restored. Neither side wanted to unleash
		their battle wizards on their oponents as the
		consequences would be most terrible. Something had to
		change and it did, in a most unfortunate way.
		</para>
		<para>
		Although much care had been put in the training of the
		wizards of the council, human weakness could not be
		eliminated. Somewhere, somehow, the brotherhood got to
		one of the chosen wizards and through bribery or some
		other means, convinced her to betray her battle brothers
		and the council.
		</para>
		<para>
		Most of the battle wizards in the service of the council
		died on that fateful night. Slaughtered mercilessly and
		some needlessly. There were no reported survivors.

		Sho-sa Mogataro Kimura
		<literallayout><emphasis role="bold">Palace of Unity</emphasis>
		<emphasis role="bold">Luthien</emphasis>
		<emphasis role="bold">Draconis Combine</emphasis></literallayout>
		
		<para>"I have to admit it, I would have rather pet a hungry shark," The 
		man thought as he walked towards the coordinator's office, "but 
		people do not refuse an invitation from the coordinator of the Draconis 
		Combine... besides I am curious." As the uniformed warrior walked to 
		the door of the Coordinator's office he saw two men with swords drawn and 
		his mind kicked into overdrive and action.</para>
		
		<para>As he drew his sword he called for the attackers to stop. The 
		enemies did indeed stop, turned around and charged the man who had 
		interrupted their mission. The Katanas flew in the hands of the swordsmen 
		who attacked without pause and without consideration for their own 
		safety. Suddenly the enemy swordsmen withdrew from the battle and a new 
		man  appeared next to them.</para>
		
		<para>The man was Theodore Kurita, the coordinator of the Draconis
		combine and the commander of the Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery. I
		quickly sheathed my katana and bowed to the Coordinator. "Sho-sa
		Kimura, I presume..."</para>
		
		<para>"Yes, Thodore-sama." The man was quick to reply.</para>
		
		<para>"Stand up and come with me." The coordinator's voice was gentle
		yet commanding. I followed him to a small chamber that was seldom
		used, the dust settled in the furniture was signal enough.</para>
		
		<para>I remained stading as the coordinator sat down. "Please sit down 
		Sho-Sa." The coordinator indicated the chair across from him and smiled 
		thinly as I sat down.</para>
		
		<para>"We have a problem sho-sa." The coordinator said without preamble. 
		"We recieved reliable reports that the crusader clans are preparing a 
		new offensive and the final repudiation of the truce of Tukayid."</para>
		
		<para>I blinked several times as I stuggled to keep my composture. What 
		they coordinator had said would spell the end of the Truce bargained by 
		Comstar against the clans back in 3052.. the never ending war would 
		resume and there was no telling how would the Combine fare.</para>
		
		<para>The coordinator nodded, as if reading my thoughts. "If we don't
		stop them, all the sacrifices our people have done will be in vain,
		sho-sa."  The next statement caught me by surprise, "I know that you
		and sho-sa Ryan were good friends... I will ask that you assemble
		4 DEST teams and meet me in orbit for a trip to Tukayid."</para>
		
		<para>I nodded as I remembered my friend. Michael Ryan was the leader of 
		Task Force Serpent's DEST teams and one of the few survivors of that 
		hellish world. While we lived to serve the Dragon, worlds like Huntress 
		made me wonder why I was still as soldier. I bowed again as the 
		coordinator spoke.</para>
		
		<para>I nodded slowly, honored that the coordinator chose me for the 
		msission yet, at the same time a little apprehensive. "If I may be so 
		bold, sir; Why me? There are surely other officers on the DEST program 
		better qualified..."</para>
		
		<para>The coordinator interrupted, "As you may or may not know, there
		are elements within our military that do not approve of my having
		named Victor Davion commander of the SLDF." The other man nodded with
		a grim look on his face... the Black Dragon Society had used its
		influence to try to remove the Precentor Martial of Comstar as
		commander of the Star League Defense Force without success, now the
		coordinator was concerned that these same reactionary elements would
		attempt something against him or against the Star League. "I am trying
		to fulfill my mandate as First Lord without jeopardizing my realm in
		the process." The coordinator paused again, "You're the only officer
		in the DEST program that I feel I can trust without reserve.</para>
		
		<para>With those words, he stood and said, "You will assemble 2 teams
		of DEST commandos and will train with them for 3 months, after which
		you will head for Tukayid for your mission briefing, understood?"</para>
		
		<para>"Hai, coordinator sama." I answered as the man who ruled my
		nation walked to the door and left.</para>
		
		<literallayout><emphasis role="bold">Jumpship White Wolf</emphasis>
		<emphasis role="bold">Space near an unnamed asteroid</emphasis>
		<emphasis role="bold">Deep Preiphery</emphasis></literallayout>
		
		<para>The crew was excited and with good reason. If the reports were 
		correct, this would be the finding of a lifetime... The captain of the 
		Comstar exploration jumpship thought as he aligned his ship with the 
		asteroid mentioned in the report. </para>
		
		<para>"We're ready to board the asteroid, sir.... transmit the
		security code" came the call from the boarding party's commander. The
		captain of the Jumpship transmited the code that would, hopefully,
		open the asteroid and reveal its prize.</para>
		
		<para>The crew of the jumpship could only see light coming from the
		asteroid, nothing more. There was a long silence from the boarding
		party and then, suddenly...</para>
		
		<para>"Sir... I think you should bring your shuttle down here
		ASAP. You've got to see this." The voice of the boarding party's
		leader was shaky. The captain turned towards the Wolf's XO and
		ordered, "Have a shuttle and a squad of marines ready to go in 15
		minutes... I've got to see what has Mr. Lawrence so worked out about."
		The XO nodded and left to prepare the shutttle as instructed.</para>
		
		<para>Once the shuttle landed the captain understood why the boarding
		party commander was so amazed and almost speechless. Parked there
		almost on top of each other there were 2 Star League warships. His
		boarding party commander came up behind him and said, "Impressive,
		isn't it sir?</para>
		
		<para> The captain nodded and asked, "Do we have an ID on the ships?"
		A technician handed him a data pad with information about the
		ships... yet another thing to be impressed. The warships were a
		McKenna class battleship, the SLS York, and a Potemkin Troop Cruiser,
		the SLS Yamato. "This is impossible, according to the ComStar
		Archives neither ships survived the SLDF exodus."</para>
		
		<para>"Well, sir. If these are forgeries, then they are the best damn
		copies I've seen in my life." A senior technician answered... The two
		ships laying there were nothing short of miraculous. "A McKenna class
		battleship and a Potemkin troop cruiser... who would have thought this
		possible?"</para>
		
		<para>The crew of the Whitewolf stood there as they contemplated their
		prize catch for the year. "Inform the Precentor Martial that we've
		accomplished out objective and that we're begining the refit process
		to take them home."</para>
		
		<literallayout><emphasis role="bold">Focht War College</emphasis>
		<emphasis role="bold">Tukaiyd</emphasis>
		<emphasis role="bold">Comstar Intervention Zone</emphasis></literallayout>
		
		<para>"So we see that it was the lack of attention to colonial worlds
		that preciptated the civil war on Earth and, indirectly, led to the
		formation of the Star League." The instructor was dressed in the white
		robes of a Comstar adept, it was only his rank insignia that indicated
		he was a Precentor and the letter alpha next to it, indicated that he
		was a mechwarrior. "We have time for one more question. Anyone?"</para>
		
		<para>A young woman stood up and looked at the instructor, "Sir, if
		the civil war on Earth is the indirect cause of the formation of the
		Star League, then why didn't Admiral McKenna form something like the
		Star League when he had the backing of the military after the
		war?"</para>
		
		<para>"Good question Corporal Thomas." The instructor nodded
		approvingly. "The first part of the answer is to look at the
		geopolitical situation at the time. There was no unity and what we now
		call the successor states were still loose confederations without firm
		political control." There was a brief pause. "And furthermore the
		military power of the alliance was not firm enough to confront any of
		these new states. I believe that was the root cause.</para>
		
		<para>As he was going to finish the answer, the bell rang and he
		smiled, "Let's save the rest for tomorrow, shall we?" Another brief
		pause. "Class dismissed." As the students filtered out of the
		classroom, a yeoman brought the instructor a letter. "Precentor
		Cameron, the Precentor Martial would like to see you as soon as
		possible."</para>
		
		<para>As Precentor Cameron walked to the Precentor Martial's office he
		wondered what kind of trouble he had gotten himself into. He briefly
		remembered having survived both the Battle of Tukaiyd and Operation
		Bulldog and how he was taken off active duty because of an alleged
		case of harrasment against civilians. He also remembered his service
		with the Davion Heavy Guard before joining Comstar and how they used
		to kick the Combine's ass at every turn until Theodore Kurita taught
		his people how to really fight. He arrived at the Precentor Martial's
		office and knocked on the door... He was motioned to go inside.</para>
		
		<para>He knocked and went in when indicated and was surprised by the
		people in the roomand who I didn't see. Precentor Martial
		Steiner-Davion was there as well as Anastasisu Focht, the former
		precentor martial;  Jerard Cranston, intelligence chief for the SLDF;
		Victoria Pardeau, Precentor ROM and another 15 or so officers that he
		was not able to identify... what I did know is that it must have been
		important for ROM to let this many strangers so close to the Precentor
		Martial.</para>
		
		<para>"Precentor Alexander Cameron reporting as ordered, sir." Cameron
		said as he entered the room and looked around as he stood at
		attention. "At ease precentor Cameron." Victor Davion motioned his
		officer to sit down, which he promptly did. "I've asked you here to
		discuss your next assignment."</para>
		
		<para>Alexander Cameron looked around a little concerned, all this
		people were going to know what the assignemtn was and that worried the
		Comstar officer. "Sir, if I may? All these people have nothing to do
		with Comstar and they have no business knowing what our plans are."</para>
		
		<para>"But they do, Mr. Cameron." To Alex's surprise, it was Focht who
		spoke this time. "We've learnt that Clans Jade Falcon and Wolf are
		planning to break the truce, void the results of the Great Refusal and
		launch another push against Terra." Victor Steiner-Davion
		continued. "We've managed to acquire some new warships for you to
		command and are forming a unit to go against them using their tactics
		and their technologies, just as we did in Operation Bulldog."</para>
		
		<para>Precentor Cameron was speechless. He would be given command of
		an international force who's purpose would be specifically to defeat
		the clans using whatever tactics were appropriate for the
		situation. It was a validation of the tactics and doctrine that
		Cameron had been proposing as far back as his service with the Davion
		Guards: to go kick the clans when they were least expecting it and
		using their own technologies to beat them.</para>
		
		<para>Precentor Martial Steiner-Davion nodded as if reading Cameron's
		thoughts</para>

      <para>The situation on Terra was not the best at the beginning of the
      23rd century. The planet was just beginning to recover from the
      terrilble abuse it had been put under during the late 20th, 21st and
      22nd centuries. It was only natural that humanity would look at the
      stars for the answer to their problems.</para>

      <para>Terran scientists were busy trying to improve on their recycling
      and energy sources. Their first breaktrhough came with the development
      of fusion drives for their space-faring vehicles. Dr. Alejandro Paredes
      and his research group at the Massachusets Institute of Technology
      developed the first viable fusion generator as part of their efforts to
      make space travel possible.</para>

      <para>This unexpected discovery caused the nations of Terra to launch
      crash-colonizations programs and the race was on to see who could put a
      ship on another planet's surface. The United States of America, Europe
      and the Russian Federation (just another name for the Soviet Union) were
      at the forefront of the race; a race that was barely won by the
      Europeans when their starship, the ESS Aurora, landed on Mars on 2235,
      followed shortly after by the USS Pathfinder and the RSS Gagarin.
      Colonization of the red planet thus began on earnest, as did the
      competition.</para>

      <para>Back on Terra the governments were beginning to feel the streess
      that the colonization programs had put their economies under. In what
      some historians now see as an unavoidable event, the Panamerican
      Federation was founded in 2357 as a means of polling resources and
      providing much needed defenses to its member states.</para>

      <para>Tensions remained high throughout the 23 and 24th centuries.
      American and Rusian forces clashed several times over the Bearings
      Straight and only a very strong European intervention prevented the
      conflict from finally going nuclear.</para>

      <para>The European Alliance and the Russian Conglomerate were created in
      the early 2400's in response to the growing economical and military
      power of the American Federation. These big conglomerates had military
      and political preeminence while all the time absorbing smaller countries
      and weaker alliances.</para>

      <para>The first contact with Denebian forces was at a small outpost in
      Pluto in 2458. The attack was unprovoked and it began a series of such
      attacks that only stopped when the combined American and European fleets
      were able to intercept the Denebian fleet before their attack. Reported
      losses were close to 30% for the Earth forces and 100% for the
      enemy.</para>

      <para>Seeing the result of cooperation, eruopeans and americans began
      working together in other areas as well... The first joint settlement on
      Titan was completed in 2471 and the first joint unmanned mission to
      Alpha Centauri was launnched later that year.</para>

      <para>Accoording to William Aldrige (2501) "Political union was
      inveitable as both government groups had become too integrated to move
      back on time. <footnote>
          <para>Aldrige, William. Historical Analysis of the 25th century.
          Cambridge, MA. Harvard University Press</para>
        </footnote> " Professor Aldrige further states that "Had they not
      joined forces, both governments would have probably been destroyed in
      what came next."</para>

      <para>The European/American coalition began slowly absorbing the smaller
      alliances and independent countries, further isolating the Russian
      Federation... The Russians attacked eastern Europe without provocation
      on early winter, 2490.</para>

      <para>The Allied forces were caught unprepared and were pushed beyond
      the Foulda gap in Germany and pushed towards the Atlantic Ocean. Allied
      military commanders began recieving reinforcements in the form of Battle
      Armor Regiments (the 101st Aerospace Assult, the 101st and 82nd
      spaceborne) and aerospace assets (the 27th and 366th Composite Aerospace
      wings). Their strategy was simple: to stop the Russians and to send them
      back to the borders before it was too late.</para>

      <para>There are hundreds of witness accounts of the war (Matsumoto 2500
      <footnote>
          <para>Matsumoto, Wayne. A Time for War. New Hope Press</para>
        </footnote> , Russian Confederated Press 2499 <footnote>
          <para>Russian Confederated Press. A day of glory. Moscow: Russian
          Confederated Press</para>
        </footnote> ) but, perhaps, the most revealing source of information
      is the now declassified report of the supreme allied commander in
      Europe, where he expresses misgivings about the actions he was being
      order to do and the cost on human lives. The 3 star general was later
      court martialed when he refused to deploy chemical weapons against
      Russian civilians. His successor, Admiral Ronald Pointdexter also
      refused to deply the bio-weapons and, instead, deployed special forces
      groups to eliminate the enemy's command and control facilities.</para>

      <para>Forces under the command of LtCol (now retired) Sean Cameron
      launched an infiltration raid that interrupted the Russian C3 (command,
      control and communications) infrastructure long enough to allow the
      Allied Forces to mount a counteroffensive that pushed the Russians
      forces off Europe and convinced them not to attempt it again.</para>

      <para>World War III was costly... cassualties ran as high as 34% for the
      Russians and 27% for the Allied forces. After the mourning and
      comtemplative periods were over, the people of the world looked at their
      governments to provide leadership for peace, not war. Europeans,
      Americans, members of the African Nations and the Assian Coprosperity
      Spehere signed the articles of incorporation, giving shape to the United
      Earth Federation in 2500 as a means of increasing the prosperity and
      well being of all the people of Earth.</para>

      <para>The Russian Federation laughed at the idea of one central
      government and decided to withdraw to their own territory and develop
      their own resources.</para>

      <para>The stage was set for mankind's next big conflict... The Denebian
      War.</para>

		<title>Why the Wolves</title>
		<para>The Space Wolves caught my attention even before I started
		playing Warhammer 40k. There is something in their culture and
		traditions that appealed to me the player. Even looking at the box for
		the Space Wolves battle force makes it look cool, don't you think? :)</para>
		
		<para>Yet there are so many stories to tell about the wolves and I
		think they deserve even a meager attempt such as this to do so.  The
		wolves are noble and loyal people... but who do they put their utmost
		loyalty first? What happens when they are set</para>
		</preface>
		
		<chapter>
		<title>The time of the wolf</title>
		<para>The Feast of Russ was as sumptuous as any of the wolves
		remembered it. The servitors and other members of the Space Wolves
		Chapter had worked hard, fought even harder and now it was their time
		to celebrate and remember the comrades that had died in battle and
		would now come back to fight with Russ at the Wolftime. The strong
		fenrisian mead was consumed freely and the wolf priests reetold the
		stories of their people.</para>

		<para>
		"We are ready for the assault Lord Aurelius," a servitor
		reported to the figure in the command room. "Very well,
		make the thunderhawks ready. I will join the assault
		force shortly." The man, Lord Inquisitor Aurelius,
		replied in a confident voice.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		As he boarded his Thunderhawk assault boat and saw it
		launched from the Emperor's Spirit, the inquisition ship
		that had brought them to this planet, Auerlius mind
		wandered at the turns of events that had brought him to
		this point...
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The brothers of the Grey Knights space marine chapter
		and the storm troopers assigned to his task force made
		Aurelius feel invincible. The Grey Knight brothers in
		Terminator Armor made the assault force a powerful one,
		despite their small numbers. Aurelius was counting on
		Grand Master Titus and his troops to achieve a swift
		victory.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		As the thunderhawks landed they disgorged the troops and
		took off again to provide fire support for the assault
		force. Aurelius moved to the front and left the command
		of the forces to Titus one of the best, if not the best
		solider, Aurelius had ever known.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The sounds of battle filled Aurelius ears as the grey
		knights, the inquisitorial storm troopers under the
		command of Sargeant Marcus, advanced towards the enemy
		stonghold. They were met by heretics, mutants and chaos
		space marines, those who had sided with Horus and the
		forces of chaos during the war that almost destroyed the
		imperium.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The Grey Knights formed a perimeter around Aurelius as
		he and his retinue advanced through the clouds of
		enemies. Where a weapon hit an enemy fell dead or
		wounded beyond hope. Aurelius daemon hammer crushed a
		cultist's head as he tried to tackle him down. Titus's
		Nemesis weapon cut a renegade imperial guardsman in half
		as he attacked from the side. The storm troopers, culled
		from the Cadian 8th regiment, poured a massive ammount
		of fire as the imperial forces moved towards the temple.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The temple had originally been an imperial temple where
		people venerated and worshiped. The chaos forces had
		desecrated it with symbols of chaos and corruption.
		Many thousands of people had been sacrificed to the
		Chaos Gods and they had heard the prayers of their
		followers. The first sacrifices had brought the chaos
		space marines forth to do battle. And now the priests
		and sorcerers and cultists of the chaos God were
		preparing to summon a demon prince into the world to
		condemn it for all eternity.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The closer they got to the sacrifice altar, the combat
		got blodier and more personal. The Nemesis weapons
		carried by the gray nights were supplemented by their
		psychic powers of the inquisitor lord and the grey
		knights themselves. Warp energies were used to fight the
		evils of the warp.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		A tall warrior of chaos dressed on battle armor similar
		to that of the Grey Knights strode forward to confront
		the forces of the Emperor. As Aurelius moved to accept
		the challenge a strange quiet fell on the place. The two
		warriors moved to engage and suddenly the sounds of
		combat broke out again as both the Inquisitor's Force
		Glaive and the Chaos Sorcerer's demon sword clashed over
		and over as each of the fighters sought an advantage
		over the other.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		Channeling all his fury and desire to destroy the foul
		chaos's spawns, Aurelius concentrated his power on his
		weapon as he struck the sorcerer's head, smashing it as
		the weapon went through the enemy's deffenses.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		A large cloud appeared and took humanoid form. Aurelius
		breath quickened for a second. It was a blood thirster
		demon that looked familiar to the leader of the Team
		Omega
		</para>
		
		<para>
		"Inquisitor Aurelius." The guttural voice emerged from
		the monster as it fully materialized. "I told you we
		would meet again."
		</para>
		
		<para>
		"I vanished you once and I shall do it again if needed
		be, infernal beast" Aurelius made a slight hand motion
		and the Grey Knights and acolytes that made his
		bodyguard prepared their weapons to do battle against
		the demon of chaos

      <para>San Francisco; Friday April 3rd; 2200 hours at the headquarters
      building of the TTC (temporal tourism company), maybe the all time more
      wealthy and popular company of all times. If you could pay their fees,
      which was possible only for the wealthiest or most influential people in
      the world, the company took you anywere and anytime.</para>

      <para>"22 million years into Earth's past." I told the operator of the
      Chronos 1, the latest design of the TCC's ship design bureau. The
      Chronos 1 was a wonderful ship, a sphere big enough to accomodate 4
      people (that is if you don't mind having to switch places to use the
      bathroom) "To the time of the dinosaurs."</para>

      <para>This was to be my supreme advenure. I had already been everywhere
      on Earth that represented a challenge to my abilities: the Mariana's
      Trench on the south pacific, the Amazon Jungle in south america, and
      Mount Everest in the Himalaya's Mountain Chain. I felt something was
      missing and this may as well be it, didn't know why but I've learnt to
      trust my hunches..</para>

      <para>The technician's voice brought me back to reality. He reminded me
      that I only had 72 hours and that if I failed to return to the ship on
      that time, it would return home without me. His words brought me back to
      all the preparation meetings that I had to attend as a requirement and
      the never-ending briefings where they emphasized the 'Golden Rules' of
      temporal travel. "Your time is limited to 72 after which the Chronos 1
      will return to the present without you..." and the other rule, "If you
      return, you must do so with the same weight that you departed with as
      the ship is calibrated for that weight only and who knows what would
      happen if the weight is not correct."</para>

      <para>I must have fallen asleep because, when I woke up, the office had
      dissapeared and a large forest had taken its place. The trees were tall
      and had a very weird texture. I got of the ship, proud of being the
      first man to accomplish this trip so far back into prehistory.</para>

      <para>I felt something move behind me.... After 20 years of adventuring
      my reflexes and reaction times were honed to a razor's edge. I quickly
      turned around and grabed the stranger and threw it into the
      floor.</para>

      <para>As I turned the agressor to better identify it I got one of the
      biggest surprised of my life. It was a human female!. I moved back in
      fear, the TTC had assured me that there would be no humans, only
      primitive life forms... but if you call her inferior, then so am
      I!</para>

      <para>I took the stranger to the ship, from where I took some rations
      for both of us to eat. As we ate I asked her who she was and where did
      she come from. I got no answer. Shortly after dinner, she walked to a
      tree where she sat down, while I walked to a hill where I could get a
      better view of my surroundings.</para>

      <para>A brighter moon greeted me a couple hours later. I was amazed at
      the way the forest looked; I was so enraptured that I didn't noticec my
      mysterious had walked towards me and sat at my feet. Once again I was
      enraptured by her beauty... it was something I'd never seen
      before.</para>

      <para>Her voice was loud and clear when she asked me, "Why don't you
      stay here with me?" I don't know what schocked me more, the fact of
      hearing her voice or what she was suggesting me to do. I admit that I
      thought about her proposal more than I should have for it was
      tempting... I would not have minded spending the rest of my life with
      such a gorgeous woman and awa from all the trappings of civilization. On
      the other hand I had already made a life for myself on 2492 with all my
      friends and, why not admit it, all my lovers.</para>

      <para>I decided that the best thing to do was to keep going as if
      nothing was going on, walk around the immediate vicinity and take as
      many pictures as I could, remembering that I couldn't take any material
      posessions with me while 'cause the weight of the ship was carefully
      controlled at the same time, I tried as hard as I could to ignore the
      misterious woman who keept following me and evaluating everything I did.
      I stood up and walked to the ship ship so I could catch a couple hours
      of sleep. Damn it, I still had 48 hours to decide what I was going to do
      with the stranger.</para>

      <para>The next 36 hours were spent working on my image gallery and
      trying to decide what I was going to do with the misteerious stranger,
      all the while I was kept under the stranger's scrutiny</para>

      <para>I finally decided that I couldn't stay, that meant giving up and I
      would never give you that easy, I had to go back to my present and
      forget the love at first sight that I felt for my unknown beauty. I went
      back to the ship for one last time, avoiding the woman's gaze as I
      walked back.</para>

      <para>I must have fallen asleep again because when I woke up I was on
      the TTC's transfer room in San Francisco. I was surrounded by all the
      technicians who congratulated me on for the most perfect chrono-travel
      to date.</para>

      <para>I ignored them as I went to their dressing room to take a shower.
      I was exhausted both physically and emotionally. I was amazed that I
      couldn't get the strange woman out of my mind.</para>

      <para>The water caressed my body like a woman's hands, moving all over
      my body. Suddenly someone appeared on the room and opened the shower's
      courtains: It was my mysterious woman... 20 million years later!</para>

      <para>My first reaction was to grab a towel and cover myself. She smiled
      and said, "Come, come now. From what I remember, in the past you were
      not this shy." She was dressed in a black satin drees that she darkened
      only in the placces she wanted, which were not many. She was also
      carrying an ATB (Automatic Test Battery), a machine that could perform a
      series of tests and analysis automatically.</para>

      <para>I regained my voice only to ask how the hell did she make it to
      this timeline from the past. Her answer puzzled me; she said that the
      same way I had except that she had an indefinite window, as she was
      conductin biological experiments to see if it was possible to clone
      dinosaurs on our time.</para>

      <para>After I got over the initial surprise I asked her out to dinner.
      She said yes... if an only if I told her stories like the ones I told
      her when we were on that hill, where my life had begun 20 million years
      before it had really started.</para>

        <title>What about tomorrow</title>
      </info>

      <para>Paul arrived late, as usual, because of his job; which appeared
      not to have a definitive exit time. Andrea waited for him awake, laying
      on their bed.</para>

      <para>"What the hell happened to you that you're coming home at this
      time?" Andrea was really furious and upset. There had been a lot of
      crimes reported on their neighborhood. "I thought something had happened
      to you." Andrea added as she huged her husband.</para>

      <para>"You know how's work, honey." Paul replied in an apologetic tone.
      "The truth is that since the moron of our boss decided to run an
      inventory at the planetary level and the people who work on the control
      division are the ones who get the heaviest load."</para>

      <para>Once they were in bed, Paul mentioned casually, "You know? I had a
      very weird premonition..." She turned and looked at him as he continued,
      "I dreamt that the end of the world was coming and that this was our
      last day together."</para>

      <para>Without knowing why, Andrea began to cry; slowly at first but
      growing in intensity as the time passes. Her sobs woke her husband up
      who, after a little indecision, hugged her and tried to calm her
      down.</para>

      <para>"It must be some sort of mass suggestion but I also dreamt that
      this world was coming to and end." Andrea said between sobs, "And that
      the world that would replace this was going to be different. That it
      would be a world where people would look at each other's eyes and say
      what they really meant."</para>

      <para>They sat in silence for a long time... suddenly, Paul stood and
      walked to their 11-year-old twins' bedroom. As he opened the door and
      looked inside Paul wondered what would it become of them and whether
      they were right in leaving the world to them or not. When he returned to
      their bedroom, he saw Andrea sitting on the bed reading yesterday's
      newspaper. "Did you know that this was the last thing I wanted to do
      yesterday and I didn't get to do?"</para>

      <para>Paul looked at her and realized that he hadn't done a lot of the
      things he wanted to do, that there were so many things left unsaid to
      the people he loved. Moved by the impotence of not being able to say
      those things, he moved his face close to his wife's, kissed her and
      said, "This is for all the times I didn't tell you I loved you."</para>

      <para>Andrea hugged her husband, feeling old for the first time in a
      long time. "You know, I've been thinking about how life has passed us by
      and how we haven't been able to enjoy it as we have planned before we
      got married." Like all married couples, Andrea and Paul had made plans
      to travel and enjoy their life together but then the real world got in
      the way.</para>

      <para>Paul nodded and left the room and came back with a bottle of
      champagne and a couple glasses whic he promptly poured them, showing a
      skill that Andrea didn't know he had. "Before we met in college I used
      to bartend to make pocket money." Paul smiled as he offered the glass to
      his wife. "Cheers."</para>

      <para>They dranks the champagne and looked at each other for a long time
      as the time kept ticking. They kissed again and Andrea said, "I don't
      think I've ever told you this Paul, but I love you and I'm really happy
      that you were the father of my children."</para>

      <para>As they lay together, Paul thought of all the things they had said
      they would do and would never get around to do now that the world was
      coming to an end. "Andrea?"</para>

      <para>"Yes?</para>

      <para>"I love you, always have and always will." With that Paul turned
      the lights off and they would never be lit again.</para>

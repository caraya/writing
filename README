The code below is an attempt to create a Dcbook XML workflow. It will provide
ANT scripts, and the Java tools that I use to create docbook documents. 

It is not the only way to do it, XSLTProc is faster and more elegant, but 
the Java tools are portable without requiring weird installation in Windows
